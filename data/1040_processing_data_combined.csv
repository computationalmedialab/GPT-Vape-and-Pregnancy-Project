7318182458468388138,Replying to @Krystina Shamsul #vaping #breastfeed #breastfed #mom #breastfeeding #parenting #breastmilk #smoking #cigarette #ecigarettes #vape #nicotine #pediatria #pediatrician ," Okay, so on my video about smoking and breastfeeding, Christina asks, is this the same for vaping? I'm Dr. K, board certified pediatrician, mom and four, let's get into it. So one of the main things we talked about in that video about smoking and breastfeeding is about nicotine, because nicotine, when we smoke, it gets into the bloodstream, which is essentially the breast milk very quickly. So this is really gonna be the same as vaping. So those chemicals that you're inhaling and vaping into your lungs are going to enter the breast milk quite quickly. But is vaping a reason to stop breastfeeding? No, absolutely not. So the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh the potential risk with vaping. So for those of you who are not familiar with vaping, it is smoking an e-cigarette or an electronic cigarette, which is a battery-operated device that changes chemicals like nicotine and other substances into a vapor, which is then inhaled into the lungs. The issue with vaping is that it hasn't been around like a really, really long time like cigarettes have. So there are a lot of unknowns with long-term issues. But we do know that some of the additives are heavy metals. They can have flavorings and other cancer causing chemicals like formaldehyde. And one of the chemicals is diacetyl, which is a flavoring that's used in some of these e-cigarettes. And that chemical has been linked to a bliterative bronculitis. That's a mouthful to say. But it's a serious irreversible lung disease. And some of them also contain, like I said, cancer causing chemicals like formaldehyde, it can also contain itose domains and propylene glycol, which is a chemical that we see in anifres. And heavy metals like tin and lead and nickel have also been found in them. And when people evap, they do emit a gas around them, which you can probably see in like the stiny looking vapor that kind of comes out. And those do contain volatile organic compounds, which can cause issues if it baby breathes in. That vapor can also contain a significant amount of nicotine. So like a pod of e-juice for a Joel brand, e-cigarettes can contain as much nicotine as 20 regular cigarettes. For a lot of mamas who are able to quit smoking during the pregnancy or seriously cut back during that postpartum period, they're so stressed out with a newborn. I mean, that's huge responsibility. It's exhausting. They're sleep deprived. And I totally understand wanting to smoke. And a lot of mamas think that e-cigarettes are better, even though overall they're really not. But I don't want you mamas who want to breastfeed if you're smoking or vaping to stop breastfeeding. There's a lot of mamas think, well, this is really bad. So I should stop. But really the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh the risk. Again, the benefits outweigh the risk. So just like the smoking regular cigarettes, there are ways that we can limit baby's exposure to e-cigarettes. So you're going to want to feed first and then vape because the nicotine is going to get into your bloodstream very quickly. And typically that nicotine is going to peak really quickly and then it's going to kind of fall off. So it takes about an hour and a half to two hours with the nicotine level to fall by 50%, which is the half-life of nicotine. And though nicotine can last for 10 hours or more, it's safer if you can wait. If you can feed, then smoke, and then wait at least two to three hours, that's going to limit exposure. OK, so why are we so worried about nicotine and babies anyway? Well, it can interfere with their sleep patterns. It can also mess up their blood glucose regulation and thyroid issues, which can lead to the kids being overweight. Check out my other video on smoking and breastfeeding to see other effects of nicotine. OK. So ultimately, we want you to quit smoking. And honestly, probably so to you, but it's really hard and it's not going to happen overnight. So we can do something still in a baby's exposure. So never hold your baby while you're vaping. You can accidentally burn the baby with the e-cigarette, which I've seen before, that's not fun. And also the vapors that are emitted while you're vaping, the baby can breathe that in and expose them unnecessarily. And same for regular cigarettes. Try to vape outside if you can. And if you can put on like a jacket, so any of the chemicals that are emitted will get on the jacket, but the jacket somewhere baby's not going to be. And don't vape in your car either or around the car seat because you don't want it to get on those items. To be sure, when you come in, you wash your face, that you wash your hands. If you can, take a shower, that's awesome. But change out of your clothes and try to just wash off any exposed area before you hold your baby. And a safer option, if you're not quite ready to give everything up, cold turkey is nicotine replacement therapy. So that's like the nicotine gum, the patches, the lozenges, but always talk to your doctor first before starting any of those kinds of things. And I talk about those a little bit more in my other video with smoking and breastfeeding because with like the, the lozenges and the gum, you want to feed first and then do them. But the patches are a little bit different. You do want to take those off before bedtime. So check that out. Again, I'm Dr. Key and I hope this video helped.",

But something that has been going across my 4u page the last few days is actually like bothering me a lot. People shaming other moms for still smoking or vaping while they're pregnant. I am on my second pregnancy. I'm about 14 weeks and I've vaved my whole first pregnancy with my daughter. I'm not saying that it's okay and I'm not justifying it. But it is a real addiction. Nictine is a real addiction. And just with anything else, it's not going to be easy to knock. I have been on other drugs and I'm completely sober from everything except from this vape. I cannot knock this thing like at all. But why are we shaming people for that? Like really?",

7121797137045736747,Replying to @alyciacelinee vaping when pumping #doulasoftiktok #childbirtheducation #babysleep," I let this question sit for a while because I think it could be a hot topic maybe for some. And the first thing that I want to say is it's really hard to find data on most anything in pregnancy because many people don't want to study things on those who are pregnant or on those who are breastfeeding because it affects babies. And they don't want to take the risks associated with having to do a study. The other piece to this is it depends on what you're vaping. There's lots of things that go into vaping and some of those things may be more harmful than others. Do you know about nicotine so whether that's vaping or smoking cigarettes is that it enters the bloodstream through the mother's lungs and then passes pretty easily into breast milk. The biggest issue that we see is with babies sleep patterns it can affect their rest. Now we all know babies don't sleep that well. But when babies are waking for biological reasons like keeping themselves alive that's actually why babies wake up a lot in order to stir up their system and remind them to breathe and they're hard to pump. When something outside of biological reasons is doing it, we see increased risks in things like issues with blood sugar or issues with thyroid, diabetes in the future. And so there are some added health risks when we affect baby sleep patterns with outside stuff. Will vaping affect your breast milk supply more than likely not? So if that's a question, it probably won't affect your supply at all. Another piece of data is that nicotine has a half life of about 90 minutes. Half life means the time that it takes your bloodstream to get rid of it. So if you were going to nurse or pump and then either smoke or vape right after that feed it would probably be out of your system by the next feed or pump. While vaping is safer than smoking regular cigarettes, the recommendation is to not do either when pregnant or breastfeeding.",

Like people are just using this as a way to bully and it's disgusting and a lot of you people on here calling me names. I don't see that being necessary or saying what kind of mother I am when you clearly have no idea. I never said that I wasn't trying to quit and for the people that said that it was so easy for them to quit like I am proud of you for real. It's just not easy for everybody and you can do anything and everything right in your pregnancy and your child still develop these problems. I'm just saying that instead of spreading hate you know support the people that willingly admit to having a problem. Being ugly and rude has never solved anything. No nobody has to agree with me but putting me down is not getting anything done or solved. I'm just saying everybody makes choices that they're not proud of but do people sit there and bash them every day about it? No they don't. You know they support with love you know I have been trying to quit I no longer smoke cigarettes.

And it's like, okay, that still doesn't take the formality hideout of it. There are tons of other chemicals in those things that are not good for the development of fetuses in utero besides the nicotine. And that was just her quick response excuse because people were asking about it. But then some people were trying to excuse it being like, oh, it's not good for her to quit cold turkey, and it's not good for the baby to have the mother inhaling anything. Like, those things are made with formaldehyde. But who knows, the whole changing her username to Mal-Se, while still being in the first trimester screams boy-mom vibes. And you know what I mean by that. Like, the girls who have boy-mom in their bios. The hard-changing her name in the first trimester too, Mama just gives that bag already. But even if it's nicotine-free, like she claims, it's not good for the fetus either way.",

So the answer is yes, smokers can breastfeed. I first want to start off by saying, I think that smoking is terrible and I really don't recommend that anyone smoke. But I also recognize that it's an addiction and people do smoke while they're pregnant and while they're breastfeeding. So if you're unable to quit, please know that you can breastfeed your baby and I encourage you to breastfeed your baby. I'll tell you why it's a great idea to continue breastfeeding if you are a smoker. Because that infants that are in homes with smokers have an increased risk of scissor and infant death syndrome. But by breastfeeding, you actually will decrease this risk for the infant. Other things to note, if you are a smoker on breastfeeding, you may have a decreased milk production because smoking will decrease the blood flow to the breast tissue. You also may be slightly decreasing amount of fat in the breast milk, but I wouldn't worry too much about that. You want to try to smoke after you feed, not before feeding, just to reduce the exposure of the smoke being on your clothing and et cetera. And if you're willing to try to quit, highly recommend a nicotine replacement. That would be those patches or gums, things like that are safe or breastfeeding. I hope this was helpful.","Human face, Clothing, Woman, Fashion accessory and if you're willing to try to, mame, Cagoabreasgedl, decreased amount of fat in, an increased risk of aid ama, milk production, hey okay so can you smoke, smoke, an increased risk of Sid oyna, being on your clothing and, @readytoslaymana, @readytoslaymam, O TikTol, @readytaslaymanlf you smoke, @readytoslaymama, they're pregnant and while, breastfeed your bab TikTok, of smoke, an addictiondok, ok, please know that you can, breastfeeding, Canyora(reasgeed, so the answer is yes, likTok, you also may decrease, e, I first want to start off by, c TikTok, I'll tell you why it's a great, homes with smokers have 1o, they're breastfeeding ymanta, decreased amount of fatin, risk for the infant, Ke, after you feed TikTok, breastfeed your ba TikTok, an addictionkTok, Can.yow-breasyeed?, breastfeed your babyTo, you want to try to smoke, Canyaa(eased, toslaymama, much about that kok, an increased risk of sidany ma, nicotine replacemerd ko, readytoslaymama, the breast milk, Tik Tok, decrease the blood flow to, etc, because smoking will, adytoslaymama, actually will decrease this, @readytoslaymanlf you smoke, TikTk, C TikTok, and I encourage you to, Cairgebeasgeedi, nicotine replacemerdio, other things to note if you, just to reduce the exposure, TikTok, SO TIKTO, IK, there may be a slightly, smokers can breastfeed, TikTO, hemes with smokers havfiok, much about that, preadytoslaymama, oslaymama, after you feed, and people do smoke while, If you smoke, Canyowbreasted?, if you are a smoker, that would be those, O TikTok, eadytoslaymama, TikTor, not before feeding, TikTOK, koslaymama, but I wouldn't worry too, IkTok, o TikTok, brio, hope this is helpful, CTIKTOk, highly recommend a, patches or gums, decrease the blood flowto, milk productionTo, recommend that anyore, are a smoker and, @readytoslayman, but Ialso recognize that it's, CTKTO, Sudden Infant Death, is that infants that are in, and I really don't, V, the breast tissue, readytoslaymam, I, HKTok, is terrible, YES, idea to continue, an increased risk of Sid, you may have a decreased, but by breastfeeding you, things like that are safe for, ikTo, @feadytoslaymama, they're breastfeeding, recommend that anyone, dytoslaymama, fikTok, so if you're unable to gyit, ae, is terrible readslaymama, patches or gums Tikro, there may bea slightly, d TikTo, nicotine replacemerd Tiko, and breastfeed?, Syndrome TiKTOr, homes with smokers haye, saying I think that smoking, homes with smokers have, idytoslaymama, breastfeed your babyikTok, quit, but I also recognize that it's"

If you can drink without it going into your breast milk, then I just don't see why you can't smoke or vape without it doing the same. Do you know what that might be an extremely naive thing to say? So I'm not saying that's a factor or anything, I'm just saying that's how I think about it. But also I don't smoke like disposable, so I figure out something like that. The liquids I use are only 10 milligrams, which is half the amount of nicotine and there would be a noticeable weight. Not that that makes a massive difference, but obviously it does make some sort of a difference compared to the first smoke and disposable cigarettes. But yeah, I don't think I've ever had a problem with Alphys Health or anything like that. I just personally put it in the same category as drinking alcohol. But hopefully with the next baby, I won't do it at all and I won't need to even think about it.",

So a vasoconstrictor means that you're constricting blood vessels and the placenta is a big blood vessel so that constriction leads to a decreased blood flow to the baby. In addition, because you were breathing for two and you're not getting as much oxygen because of the smoke that's in your lungs, you're also hurting the baby this way. This can lead to an increased risk of preterm labor and smaller babies.

Most vapes contain nicotine, which can permanently damage a developing baby's brain and lungs. This is why CDC, Mayo Clinic, and other sources declare them unsafe to be used during pregnancy. Even the nicotine-free vapes are not safe to use because they contain other chemicals that may harm you and your developing baby. And although currently there's not enough research to determine the side effects of vaping on the fetus, you should know that it took decades of research to determine the side effects of tobacco smoking during pregnancy.","Poster, Flower, Fashion accessory, Sculpture, Human face, Man, Glasses, Person Is vaping safe during, :h aT, Reply to azuu's comment, Vaping 0 Nicotine While Pregnant - New Directions for Women, solvent, may be harmful to a developing baby., J TikTOk, paint, Mayo Clinic, Diacetyl - a chernical linked to a lung disease called bronchiolitis obliterans aka ""popcorn lung"", Using electronic cigarettes (vaping) during pregnancy isn't safe.

7280925179767819552,Ditch the vape! #pregnant #smoking #vaping #cigarrettes #womenshealth #pregnancy ," Is it safe to vape in pregnancy? Let's be clear, anything's set up in smoking cigarettes during pregnancy. In an effort to give up, many people have turned to vaping or e-sigarettes and you might be wondering if it's safe to continue with these cigarette replacements during pregnancy. First of all, we've got to consider. We're finding out more and more that vaping is not as safe as we first thought and that's a non-pregnant adult. We know it's highly addictive and the substances in the vape can be unregulated causing severe and permanent damage to the lungs over time. If you're a parent who vapes, when you've got young children in your home, they're also exposed to this smoke, which is just not a good idea. Now, thinking specifically about vaping and pregnancy, firstly, there's the nicotine. This is highly addictive and across the central barrier. So, prenatal nicotine exposure has been shown to be linked to low-birth weight, pre-tembert, and developmental issues because it can harm the structure and the function of the fetal brain. Then there's the chemicals. The aerosols contain a mixture of harmful chemicals, including formaldehyde, which can be inhaled by the pregnant person, partially developing fetus, which could affect lung and the cardiovascular system. So, my answer I'm afraid is no, it's not safe to vaping pregnancy. And if you need help stopping, then definitely reach out to your midwife, your doctor, to find a safeable turnsips.","Poster, Fashion accessory, Flower, Watch, Jellyfish, Bottle, Human face, Clothing, Woman, Bird, Computer monitor, Footwear, Person ormabnel exo18 1d, AND FUNCTION OF TEikTok, NOW THINKING SPECIFICAK, THEN DEFINITELY REACHOUT, mabneV exo8 1d, CROSSES THE PLACENTALBARRIER, MBRTH, IN YOUR HOME theobgynmum, FETAL BRAIN.@theobgynmum, nelormabneV 0018 10, 2 eohleiado, 2 eoldetedO, AND DEVELOPMENTALISSUES, halomabnel s018 x, LOWBIRTH WEGHT, REPLACEMENTS DURINGTok, d TikTok, FIRSTOFALL, WE KNOW IT IS HIGHYkTok, Villi, R, blood vessels, rpoloosanvo, CIG, nolormabneV ax01 1d, MIDWIFE OR DOCTORaynmum, AS WE FIRSTTHOUGHTgynmum, c TikTok, MANY PEOPLE HAVETURNERK, nelormabnel x8 d, TO CONTINUE WITH THSSok, CIGARETTE @theobgynmum, nelomabneV x018 1, VAPE AEROSOLS CONTANTok, NO,, COSET-@theobgynmum, H, WE KNOWIT IS HIGHYikTok, wlormabnaV, CARDIOVASCULARSYOFRM, PREGNANCY?, SOI'M ANSWER, AND SUBSTANCES INTHEVARE, ADULTS, WHICH IS NOT A GOODD5Aok, Umbilical cord, any 2 eohdetedo, WEHAV TRTok, YOU MIGHT BE WONDERIKok, 2, eoidetedo, INCLUDING FORMALDEHYDE, THAT VAPINGIS NOT ASSAEK, TO CONTINUE WITH THESrok, EXPOSURE HAS BEEN&INKEDum, kpokoeany 2 eoideedo, PREGNANCY?@theobgynmum, .poiosa a eoldetedo, @x0018 1, cord, C TikTok, THE LUNGS OVER MEgynmum, ntmbel s a, WHICH CAN BEINHALED BYBRT, AND THATIS IN NON-PRENANT, Placental, SMOKING CIGARETTES, MANY PEOPLE HAVE TURNERK, nelomabney @xco18, ADDICTIVE, CONSIDER THAtheobgynmum, TO VAPING AND E-CIGARETES, TikTok, TOFIND ASAFER.eobgynmum, vpokoean a eoitetedo, IN AN EFFORT TO GFKTok, IS IT SAFE TO VAPE, SMOKE, IT IS NOT SAFE TO VAPMKTok, 2 eoietedo, nelormabnev x018 i, TO VAPING AND E-CIGARETTES, nelormabnsV x01 1, THE STRUCTUREtheobgynmum, IN PREGNANCY?, HaredO, toideted0, am, Nicotine, nelormabnsl x018 1, Nic, Fetus's blood, Placenta, PREGNANGY?, Ypokosan a eohtetedO, Ypoloean a 2oldatado, AND PERMANENT DAMASETO, WHICHCOULDCAUSELUMSA+?, tpokcosan eoldetadO, .mabnel slo8 d, MIXTURE OF HARMFUL CHEMIGALS, Opereruca GAUS, .poicceany zollatedO, .polcowano, CARDIOVASCULARSYR@FERMR, Umbilical, vpolcosan 2 eoidetedo, WHICH CANHARM TikTok, Mother's, PRENATAL NICOTINE TikTok, Ypokcosanyo 2 eohdetado, nelomabnel 018 x, CAN BE UNREGULATED, VAPES, ABOUT VAPING AND PREGNANGY, nelomabneV x8, imabnel x018 1d, Kpokcoean eoldaledo, AND FUNCTION OF TFikTok, vessels, o TikTok, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASESmum, AS WE FIRST THOUGHTgynmum, kpolcosany a aohteted, nelormabnel x08 10, vpolcosem a eoitetedO, THEN THERESA CHEMEPALSK, IT IS NOT SAFE TO VAPKTok, OsanO, cosanvo, lormabneV x018 10, veoice, ANYTHINGIS BETTERTHAN, nelormabnel x8 1d, -, WHICHCOULDCAUSELUN3.AA?, ALTERNATIVE, .po a 2oideledo, okosanyo, ARE ALSO EXPOSED TOHSok, UP SMOKING@theobgynmun, rpolcoeany a eohdoledo, I'M AFRDalfok, nelormabnsV x08 10, cTikTok, rekeabel, NOW THINKING SPECIFIAYK, TO VAPE-IN, nslormabneV ao8, JUNO, @theobgynmum, AND GOT YOUNG CHILREN, DURING PREGNANGTok, V, IF YOU ARE A PARENTo, . 2 cord, WHICH COULD CAUSE LUNSAND, Ypolcosany a eoldetedo, SEVERE, a eohtotedo, nelormabneV x18, nolomabnel x 1d, nelommabnsl 08, nabnsl x0018 1d, .poicosany 2 zoldetedo, THIS IS HIGHLY ADDICTIVEANRok, THE PREGNANT PERSONgynmum, cotine, WHICH CAN BE INHALED BYBRTK, Ypokoesn 2 eoldetado, CAUSING, IS IT SAFE, PREGNANCY @theobgynmum, THE PREGNANT PERSQNgynmum, ADDICTIVE @theobgynmum, WHICHIS NOT A GOODD5Aok, IF YOU NEED HELP STOPPINS THE, mabnel xoon8 10, a eoitul, 1102, IFITIS SAFE @theobgynmum, space, nelomabnel x18 1, PAST THE DEVELOPING FTHSok, FIRST OF ALL, nelrmabneV ex, THIS IS HIGHLY ADDICTIVERok, AND PERMANENT DAMASETS, WHICHCOULDCAUSELUN3A+, VAPE AEROSOLS CONTATok, THEN THERESACHEMIALSk, ypokcosanyo a eoidetedo, nolc, melormabnsl x018 1d, slormabnsV x018 10, CARDIOVASCULARSYROFERM, THAT VAPINGIS NOT ASSA5K, 0, Chemical Exposure, THE LUNGS OVER TMEgynmum, Intervillous, mlormabnsl x0018 1, nolo, TO YOUR, GAUS, ABOUTVAPING AND PREGNANGY, LETSBECLEAR, melomabnsl x018, PRENATAL NICOTIME Tik Tok, rpokcosan a eoiotedo, membrane"

I just want to say before I start talking about it that no one should criticize a mum for how she does her pregnancy. You've got to think at the end of the day what you see on the internet is in a hundred percent what it's like all the time and you've got to realise that there's a lot of things that go on behind closed doors, never, never know what someone is going through or has been through and why they are doing a certain thing. The reason why I smoked, well I didn't smoke, I've raped while I was pregnant with Hazel Grace was because beforehand I was smoking a 20-deck in two days because of my mental health and stuff that I had been through a few years before I was even considering having a baby. As soon as I found out I was pregnant I stopped smoking cigarettes straight away but my doctors and health care professionals and stuff like that did not recommend that I cutted nicotine out altogether because that would cause me a lot of distress with mental health problems that I have. I tried nicotine patches and stuff like that but it didn't work for me. The nicotine patches made me nauseous. I couldn't have the chewing gum because I had braces at the time and eastergurettes was... Yeah, so they did not recommend I cut it out altogether because it would cause me a lot of distress. So I went to vaping which they said was perfectly fine. Me and Jack both eastergurettes and yeah they said that was okay. All the health care professionals threw up a hole in my pregnancy said that was fine. So just don't criticise moms for doing it. Everyone has their own coping mechanism. Just remember that. You never know what your comment could do to somebody. So just... Or just don't comment on it. If you don't do it, I'll give you hats off to your congratulations on everything and good luck to it but I personally couldn't do it myself.","Fashion accessory, Necklace, Human face, Clothing, Woman, Boy, Girl, Dress 2, C, smoke when pregnant, I, NoT, J, I'll never understand, d TikTOk, P, a, t, S, C TikTOk, -, d TikTok, why people vape/, TikTok, d, N, @rhian.foster200, 1, J., TikTOk, Reply to katie1727374\'s comment, G)"

We know a little bit about nicotine. We do know that if you smoke too much nicotine, it will decrease your supply, especially if you're up to like a pack a day. We also know that nicotine kind of stays on the skin and it's easily transferred to the baby. So we have some recommendations that you smoke outside, you wear a jacket, things like that. Vaping's a little different because it's not regulated, it's not well studied, and not everything is consistent with every type of vaping utensil. And so what we're saying right now is, vaping can wait. You know, finding something else that will help you deal with stress, maybe something that you enjoy, something that's more of a distraction. Whatever it is that you're using vaping to suppress, find a different alternative right now while you're breastfeeding. And hopefully we'll have more evidence and settings in the future so we can have a more specific answer for you. But thanks for asking.","Book, Human face, Clothing, Woman, Houseplant, Person COWTHES, .ng- .sing Mer, Cong.

7322348368917826823,," I look so fucking orange today. I think I will overboard with the bronze up. But anyways, I wanted to talk about something because I was really shocked in my life this morning. We were talking about pregnancy and nicotine. And basically I was saying that it is safe to quit immediately. Cold turkey if you find out your pregnant people in the comments did not know that and that has shocked me. I think we get it misconstrued with harder substances which yes, if you quit cold turkey you are actually at risk of severe withdrawals that are life threatening. Not only to you but your baby yes you would go and shock some people lose their life when they quit. Heavy substances cold turkey. We are talking about nicotine people. I spent five minutes on the internet and it says if you are pregnant it is best if you can stop smoking right away. Like you could keep reading that if you want to, it is my house. And then this is from the public health which says lots of women cut down on cigarettes when they find out they are pregnant. And this is a positive step which 100% it is. However, evidence tells us that only completely stopping smoking protects the unborn baby and the mother from the harm that's making causes. I'll leave that there for a bit of someone wants to screen shot it. This page is brilliant it goes in depth. If you want to the websites down the bottom of the screen there. And one more is it okay to quit smoking cold turkey when pregnant? This is what we were talking about today. Quitting smoking any time during your pregnancy will improve your baby's chances of being born healthy. Quitting smoking even cold turkey is safe during pregnancy. I spent a good decade of my life from the age of like 13 to 23 working in a pharmacy and dealt with many many many pregnant mothers. Does that make me a professional no? I've also had two kids myself and I've done. Oh shit. I think you guys I've done a lot of research. I want you guys to know and I want to put it out there on a page because I've shocked at how many people didn't know this. It is safe to quit cold turkey. It's actually going to be better for your baby. The more days you have with less nicotine in your body, the better. I also want to highlight that I do not shame or judge anyone who does smoke during pregnancy as someone who's quit many substances in my life more than what I would like to talk about online. I want you guys to know there is never any judgment from me. When I talk about this I'm just passionate about promoting the positivity of quitting smoking or vaping during pregnancy. It's only going to be positive I promise. There has been this narrative of it shocks the baby. I want you guys to know that there's evidence to prove that's completely untrue and that you are only going to benefit you and your baby's health from quitting.","Car, Poster, Lipstick, Human face, Clothing, Woman, Girl, Man, Person necessarily reduced their exposure, research highlights the possible damage - to, A, only completely stopping smoking protects the, In pregnancy, positive step.

The pregnant woman sitting behind Bobert told the Denver Post she asked her to stop vaping, and Bobert refused. Her one woman show continued, taking flash photos, raising her hands and dancing, often the only one clapping or standing up in the crowd. Bobert occasionally took a break from being disruptive to enjoy the company of her male companion. He briefly had a grasp on the situation before Usher's returned, and told Bobert she had to leave.

I was left quite a re-comment on one of my videos in regards to the fact that I have vaping and I am 3 months pregnant. I am going off midwife advice. I have completely stopped smoking since finding out I was pregnant and I am using nicotine patches and vapes to curvy craving which is safe. It is the carbon monoxide in real cigarettes that is harmful to the baby so the nicotine does not have an active effect on the baby at all. And when somebody has tried for almost 8 years with this baby and then getting rude comments. To be made to feel like a failure then please just not leave any rude comments at all. Just sort of educate yourself.

7294662395891404074,you can do this! 💛  - #quitvaping #quitvapingwithme #quitnic #quitnictok #quittingnic #quittingtips #pregnant #pregnancy ," This is how I successfully quit vaping after four years of vaping constantly. I had tried to quit so many times and failed miserably, so these are the things that actually helped me. First and foremost, you need a purpose for quitting. That's to yourself how your life could be better if you quit vaping. You're gonna save a lot of money. You're going to be better in your health. You'll be saving time. You're preventing any underlying health conditions from worsening. My reasoning was that I was pregnant and I really did not want to hurt my baby. I was really scared that when I found out that I was pregnant, that I wouldn't be able to quit vaping. This was the first time that I tried to quit that my purpose was so much more important than the vape was that I would have stopped at nothing to make sure that I quit. So here are the things that actually help me quit. I think you should tell your friends and people that care about you that you are quitting. If these people know that you're quitting, they can be there for you when you're going through withdrawals. They can cheer you on and encourage you to continue quitting and you won't want to let them down. Next, I would download an app that has a timer that will tell you how long it's been since you hit your vape the last time. I promise you, you will not want to restart that timer. If you want to curb your cravings, I would say to chew on ice. Not only will you be getting that hand-to-mouth fixation that everyone has when they're vaping, but it's also a really good option if you're worried about gaining weight when you quit vaping not gonna be indulging in excessive amounts of calories. It's also cold and a lot of vapes kind of feel cold when you hit them. I recommend chewing on gum or having mints with you as well. First of all, they're low calorie, but they also have that minty menthol flavor that a lot of the vapes that our popular have. Once you start getting really bad cravings and really bad withdraws, it'll be a little bit more difficult for you to regulate your emotions. But I noticed that caffeine really, really helps with that. If I was about to have a mental breakdown because I wasn't hitting my vape and I was just getting overwhelmed, I would drink a bunch of caffeine. You could hypothetically also get a CBD vape. Have tried it before. It calmed me down a little bit and I got that hand-to-mouth fixation, but in reality, I was still bringing something into my lungs. I was still smoking something. And I would recommend that you just don't smoke anything while you're trying to quit smoking. But if it works for you, it works for you, and there's no shame in that. Last but not least, I highly recommend the easy way to stop vaping by Allen Car. I had it in the audio book version on Spotify, but you can download it anywhere or you can buy the physical copy of the book. What I really liked about this book is that it didn't fear monger you into quitting. Kind of feel like you used like reverse psychology. My excuse as to why I could not stop vaping was always, oh, I'm so mean to everybody around me whenever I quit vaping, which was true. I was having emotional outbursts whenever I would quit. In this book, Allen Car relates that to a toddler not getting the toy that they want and having a tantrum, which is kind of embarrassing. He also talks about how quickly the nicotine leaves your system and how a lot of those emotional outbursts aren't due to withdrawals. It's just because you're not getting what you want. That's just one of many examples of the great reasons as to why you should quit that he gives in the book. It was so compelling that I genuinely didn't even finish the entire audio book. I listened to about half of it and I was like, yeah, you're right, I'm done. I don't eat this. I think it was only $15 as well, so it's not even expensive. Just want to say that quitting isn't as difficult as you are making it out to me or anyone else makes it out to me. If you're committed, I guarantee you can actually quit. If you have any other questions or want any other tips that I could give without quitting, definitely let me know. I would be happy to give them and I wish you the best of luck.","Lamp, Mechanical fan, Human face, Clothing, Woman, Girl luck, but they also have that, hurt my baby, just wanna say that, I promise you, encourage you to, and I wish you the best of, just one of many, or want any other tips that, than the vape was, and I was just getting, Get free from JUUL 1Q05, was pregnant, I had it in the audiobook, tanks or any other nicotine product, Get free from JUUL. 1005, worsening, I was really scared that, and how a lot of those, EASY WAY, much more important, finish the entire, care about you, quit vaping, d TikTok, but you can download it, myvape, this is how I successfully, Alan Car relates that to a, or anyone else makes it, also get a CBD vape, J1, the vapes that are popular, your system, anywhere, I recommend chewing on, if you have any other, c TikTok, and there's no shame in, it works for you, .

Doc, ano po side effect ng usok sa vape, naman ala lang hapsa pregnant. Hmm, akalap po kasi ng iba, pag nag vape ka, ay hindi ka nag sigadillo, malay, ang vape ang tauag natin ang ay e-sigrets, and most e-sigrets, still contain nicotine. They even contain other chemicals and other additives that can be harmful para post-agrobing baby ninyo. Naya, and if we see that we see that first-hand smoking or first-hand vaping, ang nanaimismo, yung pregnant, mismo yung um, nani nigarilyo, or na vape. Kapag second-hand naman, ibig sabihin, para kayong manok, kasi ka yung inosukanok, ka kwen puhanyo, kausapyo, and third-hand, kapag kapo yung mga fumes, o yung mga usok, kung mapit na sa damit, kung mapit sa kortina, sa sofa, naman lang ger ang maging exposure ng umu upo dito, diba, or yung na e-exposedito. So, whether first-hand, second-hand, or third-hand vaping, ang nico-teen magpakailan man, ay very toxic sa kalusuga ng inyong pinabubuntis. Sa first three months kung saanabubu-uren yung buddy parts nabibbi, lalo na yung heart, which is the first organ to develop, pagdona-exposed, pede huma karo ng cardiovascular defects nabibbi. In some studies, yung iba ngahong babies, e-kulang yung mga dalire, or mga digits ng kamay. Now, as the baby grows, at patulo yung exposure sa nico-teen, ang problema dito ay naka-karo o na mga insult sa brain nabibbi. And, ang mga yari niyan, pagpinawanak si baby si layong atrist na makaron ang autism spectrum disorder, si layong mga global developmental delays, kawawan naman yung baby.

If you care about your child and don't want the system getting in your business then then cut the smoking out. I'm going to tell you why. When you're smoking and your breastfeeding that all of the TACs get transferred to your baby's milk because all your baby is drinking is milk. When I was three months pregnant with my daughter I couldn't eat or drink water. Everything I eat or drunk would come back up. I'm telling the doctor like yeah I'm still smoking because I can't eat anything. I even lost a lot of weight being pregnant because I couldn't eat or drink anything. I'm telling them this so that they can put me on something that works. When they finally did put me on something that works I stopped smoking. But like five months later even when I had my daughter at the hospital they had to check for TAC in her in her in her inbilical cord and it could last up to six months. If y'all smoking while pregnant, if y'all breastfeeding while pregnant they're going to open a case on you if they draw your kids blood and find TAC in them. Let's just avoid all that. Because just because you smoke doesn't mean you're a bad parent. When that shit is in your child's bloodstream that's completely different. So please please please stop smoking and breastfeeding. Don't smoke while pregnant. Let's just let's just not do it. And I'm not saying I did it for the fun of it. My ass was literally about to go fucking anorexic. But like I said before when they did put me on some medication that worked I cut that smoking shit out. Because like it's don't even sit right in my mind knowing someone's kicking in my stomach and I'm smoking. Like it don't even feel right. Talking about the baby.",

Hi, I'm Dr. Key. I'm a board certified pediatrician and a mom of four. Let's talk about nicotine. So we all know that smoking is not great for you. I'm not here to shame you. I'm here to talk about the best way to mitigate risk for your baby. So say you've quit for the whole nine months of pregnant theory. You really cut down. And now you have a baby and your baby is crying all the time and you're sleep deprived and all you want is a cigarette. So can you breastfeed and smoke? The short answer is yes, you can. The benefits of breastfeeding, even if you're a smoker, are still far away the risks. So nicotine used to be on the list of drugs that were a contraindication for moms to breastfeed, but in 2001, the AAP removed it. And you'll see here that the benefits of breast milk outweigh the risk with nicotine exposure. So the main issue with smoking is that it exposes your baby to nicotine, and nicotine is a risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome. So how does nicotine increase the risk of sudden infant death syndrome? So in our carotids, which are these arteries that run through the neck, we have this bifurcation where the carotid splits into the internal and external carotid artery. At that bifurcation, there is the carotid body. So this is going to be a oversimplification, but essentially the carotid body senses our oxygen and whenever it gets low, it stimulates our nerves to tell our brains that we need to breathe. Well, nicotine lowers the dopamine in these carotid bodies, which essentially means that if babies not breathing effectively, these carotid bodies are not going to work like they need to to get baby to override that hypoxia and breathe. And another mechanism for how smoking can increase the risk of cids is that parents who smoke will exhale carbon monoxide for hours after they smoke. And if baby is breathing in that inhale carbon monoxide, that will lower baby's oxygen level and can lead to cids. And the risk of cids is so much more increased if you bed sure with your baby. But again, if mom or dad's smoke and baby is breastfed, the risk of cids is still lower than if mom or dad's smoke and baby is formula fed. And offering a pacifier to your baby at bedtime and nap time can help stimulate your baby. Babies who take pacifiers during sleep times don't sleep quite as deeply, which sounds like we don't want that, but we do because then if they have any trouble breathing, they're going to wake up and breathe. And this decreases risk of cids. Also when baby is sucking on a pacifier, their tongue is more forward in their mouth, which is helping the tongue not to block the airway. Okay, so we've established that even if you're smoking, it's good to breastfeed and it protects your baby against a lot of stuff, right? So when is the best time to smoke if you're going to breastfeed? The best time to smoke is right after you have a nurse because when you are smoking, that is when the nicotine is going to be highest in your blood. It spikes very quickly and then it comes down. The half-life of nicotine is usually about two hours and it takes about 10 hours for the nicotine to leave entirely. So if you smoke and you can wait at least two to three hours, that would be really great. Now this is going to be hard during the newborn phase and during those cluster feeding days because some babies want to eat every 20 minutes. Otherwise, to decrease your kid's exposure to nicotine is to cut back. So even if you cut out one cigarette a day, that's one less cigarette your baby is exposed to. Now ultimately we would love it if you quit smoking, but that's not realistic for some people and we also know it's not going to happen overnight. Relapses are super common and nicotine gum and lozenges could be helpful to help you quit and we treat these the same as cigarette. So you're going to want to nurse first and then do the gum or lozenges and then try to wait two to three hours. And if you want to do patches, that's great. I do recommend that moms take them off at night so baby isn't getting nicotine during the night because that can interrupt sleep. And some moms will ask with the nicotine patches like what dose they should do. So 21 milligrams is equivalent of about one pack a day. So if you can do seven or 14 milligrams, that's even better. And if you're needing a reason to quit, babies with parents who smoke are likely to have asthma. They're more prone to getting ear infections. Nimonious bronchitis, altered immune system, increased chance of getting diabetes and even thyroid issues. Smoking decreases maternal iodine in the breast milk and we need iodine for our thyroid to function normally. Smoking does also decrease moms prolactin, prolactin is a hormone that makes milk. So you may struggle with your milk supply, but honestly this wasn't super significant. And smoking moms tend to not breastfeed for as long as non-smoking moms, but a lot of times it's because these moms think that smoking and breast feeding is bad for the baby. When in reality, breastfeeding for a longer time is good. And be sure not to smoke around your baby. Try to go outside if you can and if you can wear a jacket, that's even better. Whenever you come in, take that jacket, put it somewhere, baby is not going to be, wash your hands, wash your face. And don't smoke in your car, even if baby's not in there. And don't smoke around the baby's car seat. And benefits of breastfeeding for you, mom, are a lower chance of getting breast cancer. It also can help with postpartum weight loss. I can tell you when I breastfed and I would eat junk at the hospital and residency, I would go pump. And also breastfeeding is good for bonding. I have moms ask all the time, are e-cigarettes or vaping better? And the short answer is no. But I'm going to try to make a video of that soon. I know that quitting smoking is ridiculously hard. I have multiple family members who have tried and tried and tried again. And they have been successful, but it does take time. So if you're struggling and you're trying to quit, call 1-800-QUIT-NOW. And if you're pregnant, you can sign up for smoke-free mom, you can text mom to 2-2-2-88 or sign up online. And they'll send you customized messages where you're at in your pregnancy. And it's great to sign up for this even if you're not ready to quit yet. And lastly, I want to say, if you want a formula fee, that is absolutely okay. And I don't want you to have any guilt about it. No one knows your family like you do. So do whatever's best for you and your baby. I hope you guys found this helpful. Like and follow her for more.",

I know they're both girls, whatever. The instant I had found out that I was pregnant, number one, I was extremely hungover, so I hadn't used my vape at all that morning. But then when I got the positive pregnancy test, I just immediately threw it away. Didn't even think twice about it.

7108800779921706283,Reply to @nessastaysnerdy #quittingsmoking, That's actually an amazing question because putting cold turkey actually can be extremely bad for you and your fetus because when you do quick cold turkey what ends up happening is you go through nicotine withdraws while you got a thing about if you're going through something like that you're gonna put more stress on your baby. So with my my first daughter who's 15 I actually did quick cold turkey. I had heard something that every time you took a hit of a cigarette their heart stopped and it freaked me out. Mind you I was like 18 and I was done. With my next child who is now four I actually spoke to my doctor and he told me just to gradually like lean off. So that's what I did and by the time I was about 15 weeks pregnant I was completely done smoking. With my next one who's two years old that actually made me sick to smoke so I was able to quit no issues no problem cold turkey.,

Why? Why though karma? There's hella reasons why or starters the past year I just feel like I found myself lacking motivation I'll get my full eight hours of sleep and I'll still wake up groggy or Just not having it, you know, I'm always fucking tired or sleepy And you know that feeling when you smoke indica It's like a mellow sedated feeling like just chilling nothing around you really matters like you're kind of spaced out and shit Yeah, I've caught myself acting like that even when I'm sober and I haven't smoked There's been multiple occasions where my girlfriend will talk to me and I'm doing something and I'll just look at her With like a blank face and I'll turn around and continue doing what I was doing just chilling spaced out Almost like I'm not all there anymore. It feels weird and Baby, you know, I want to apologize for that because you know that I always want to be the best person that I can for you And I just feel like I have it because of whatever this is that I'm feeling I'm simply just tired of the same routine every single fucking night Coming home from work and just sitting on my phone scrolling through my phone for the rest of the fucking night Shitting my life away. I used to be hell spontaneous and outgoing and like ill life's too short to be just wasting it, you know what I'm saying? And don't get me started with the anxiety that I've developed The freaking anxiety that does not allow me to do anything without smoking first I wake up smoke get home from work smoke smoke again before I eat dinner because I don't have a fucking appetite without smoking And then again smoke before going to sleep Smok smok smok smok smok smok smok smok smok smok smok smok smok smok My tolerance is like out of the fucking roof and I'm not talking about a little blood I'm talking about fat ass backwards. I've been working since I was like 13 So like I've always had the funds to just buy good shit And if you smoke with me, you know that I only smoke the good shit I've always been huge on not allowing a craving or an object control my feelings and decisions So I refuse a little plant flower to do so, right?

And then I started again after I had my son, not right away, but like. Can we hiding and doing it? No, no. Fuck yeah. No, but I also think you were. No, I mean, I never would post, like there's, you'll be hard pressed to find. There's very few photos of me smoking online, but. Yeah. But then one of my son was two, because I had my little smoking nook outside. And he came out, my son came, he learned how to open doors, you know, and he came out and was like, Mommy, Mommy, and he's like, what's that spell? And I just felt like such a loser.

7143220569113218350,Replying to @piglet270 You got this love ❤️ I believe in you ," My quit in situation may be a little different than people talking about quitting. I was smoking since I was 12 years old. Yes, I said 12 and I'm now 34 and I quit when I was seven months pregnant so I was 33. And I know everyone's like oh my god, you're a small wire pregnant. Listen, yes, I was. I'm not afraid to admit it and everybody knows it. I also smoked with all three of my other kids. I'm not going to say that other people don't experience negative outcomes but all four of my kids so far have been healthy and great. What made me finally quit and make sure you stay till the end because I have something else to say. What made me finally quit was because I had a really bad asthma attack and I literally could not breathe. Usually if I have an asthma attack I go to the hospital, I get a treatment and I'm good going forward. This time it did not work like that. I had asthma attack when I got a treatment came home, had another asthma attack when I got a treatment came home. Finally had another asthma attack was in the hospital for a little bit and then I came home. And for a little bit I mean a few hours upon hours and when I got home I was like I am not smoking them where I quit cold turkey. I already really did. I smoked like three or four cigarettes a day but this time I was like I'm done. I didn't pick up another cigarette. However, I currently started smoking again about a month ago. And again it's only a few cigarettes a day but I have started smoking again. Yes it is bad to smoke when you're pregnant but it is extremely hard. Do not let people judge you. Don't let people judge you. It is extremely hard. People that haven't smoked don't know how hard it is. And some people would be like well when I was pregnant I stopped smoking right away and it was easy. And that's good for them. But what works for one person may not work for another person. My husband had also stopped smoking at the time with me. He knows smokes again but he also had stopped smoking at the time and he smoked a lot. And what helped him stop is he had freshments with him. I meant to say breathments and those helped him stop the cravings. So I will say this to you. You do what you feel is best. Take all the advice from the doctors to help you stop smoking. Even if you just cut down to a couple of days that is amazing for you. That is amazing. I am studying you so much while wishes. I know you got this. I know you can do it if you quit and if you don't that's okay too. Don't listen to people as far as them be a negative. Do what's best for you love.","Fashion accessory, Book, Human face, Woman, Clothing, Girl, Person smoking make it worse, BO TH, UNDY, AUC, smoking make it worse?, NJ0m9M, FIEE, WGMOLJ62, BUDY, abr, astomab, E, abns, abn9iri, 29i10m9l, 2shom9M, *yes I know having asthma &, 23, 9iT, abn9iT4, d TikTok, 29i10m, 2910m9, rISE, NVAR, c TikTok, aVAZ, *no I don't smoke around the, 2bni, FIRE, eiomstt, negative outcomes?

Today is, so I don't know if I've posted anything on my birthday, but I am 30 now. Shout out to me. But my journey is still going. I did have a couple of bumps in my zone, depression comes and shout out, I have a shout out. But, I'm stronger than I am. I'm the fight better, so I don't know. Get up there, but any who. We out here, and today is day one of me not smoking marijuana. It's on your hottest, it's about to be a task, especially with both my kids. The bigger one is the one that's probably going to get on my nerves the most. But we won't see how this goes. We really want to pray, I need you to pray for me. I'm a praying, and I need you to pray with me. Like, we're all baby. But yeah, like, we want a little journey. I'm going to give you a day-to-day update. I'm going to try my hardest to child, you know. Give you guys a little insight on how it is being a mom of two million, because that's what I am. I know, if my whole baby girl who thinks she's a boss, and that's what I'm actually wants to do, my six year old who thinks he's 16, he'll be seven next Tuesday, I believe. So yeah. Life is changing, so we're about to get this day, we're about to get to this buddy, and we're going to change our life all around. And that's just what we're going to do.

I know this is about to be a task. Like, a task. And they say you go through withdrawals, like I don't even know how that's going to work, but I've tried before, like don't give me wrong. Stop smoking before. But to actually just quit cold turkey for no reason at all, it's just like, I guess the reason. But, you know, when you get smoking first from home, I think it's only going to take some time. But we're going to do it. So day one, this is January 20th, and right now it's 11.29 in the morning, 11.30. We're going to do this, okay? We're going to get it done. Day one. Y'all with me?

I'm probably gonna get a lot of shit for this and I just really don't care because you know what? I was told not to quit smoking cold turkey because I would put too much stress on the baby and I would probably lose him. So I was recommended to vape and slowly stop smoking. Not only that, but I was also recovering addict. I had actually gotten sober a month before I got pregnant and I was already taking subutex. I didn't want to take subutex during my pregnancy but I was told that if I had stopped I would have miscarried. I see a lot of people saying that these girls vaping or smoking or whatever during pregnancy are choosing addiction over their children and that is not true. If you've never been there you don't know the facts. I never chose addiction to anything over my son.

Let's talk about it. But let's get to the punchline. That is absolutely not true. Quitting, smoking and pregnancy will only benefit your pregnancy. It does not lead to miscarriage at any point in the pregnancy. Although quitting smoking earlier in pregnancy as early in pregnancy as possible will be the best for the pregnant individual and the fetus. If you quit smoking at any point in pregnancy that will be beneficial to the pregnancy as well and the fetus. In this video they also talk about how they're reducing the number of cigarettes smoked. But unfortunately reducing instead of cessation which means stopping completely has not shown in to improve the perinatal outcomes. Smoking is smoking unfortunately and the best thing to do is just stop. The best thing to do is just to stop smoking.",

My husband's only seen me vape three times in our entire relationship. That's how well I hide it. It's trashy, it's not good for you. And like I've been on this wellness journey and quitting. It's kind of like the last step. So I haven't vaped in seven days. Also just an update like working out five days a week, two days of rumble, walking. I'm just eating whole foods, not counting calories, just eating things that make me feel good. Doing a lot of strength training and making my back super strong.

7278300724759416106,"#vaping and #smoking can have a catastrophic impact on both male and female fertility. If you’re struggling to get pregnant and beat, this might be the first step to becoming healthier."," So how much does vaping actually hurt your fertility? Vaping was originally started in Australia as a way to help people to stop smoking. There's some misinformation that some vape pens are healthier than others and they research this doesn't support that. Regardless of what you've heard, all vape products have been shown to disrupt your hormones. There are some rumors that some vape products are healthier than others and the reality is that all vape products have been shown to seriously disrupt your hormones, your reproductive organs, and can really affect the morphology of this firm, which is the DNA of this firm. In fact, smoking and vaping are probably some of the worst things that you can do for sperm. They've also been shown to have heavy metals like lead and mercury, which you really want to avoid. Be careful when you're using omegas because they can also be contaminated with this as well. Y'all, these solvents that they use in vape products are the same things that they use to make paints to first. It's really serious. I know it looks really benign to just like take a puff off of vape pens, but it actually can have serious consequences for your health, your fertility, and your sperm. It's kind of one of those things that you know is probably not a good idea, but when you look at the data showing especially that it decrees the viability of the sperm by almost 30%, that it's something you completely want to stop or avoid doing if you're on a fertility journey. Now, if you have any questions, ask them in the comments.

Um, I started chewing on straws again, which was a habit that I've had since I was seven years old and I stopped a few years ago. Um, I cried because I wanted Genji to go so bad and now I don't even want it because there's not enough yum yum sauce. And I'm on a most fun fucking wreck. So... Yeah.

So last night, I definitely didn't talk about one of the major things that I quit doing and that was vaping. I have been vaping for, I don't know, four years. Oh my God, that's all so bad. So I have been 11 days free of the vape. At first, the picking up, putting something down motion, hard to kick, hard to kick. But now, it's mainly right after I eat. Like I feel like I have to wanna pick something up or carry something around with me, like little buddy, but I don't need it and I know I don't need it. It's all in my brain. So we're making it through and it's only getting easier. That's for sure. As for things that are better already, food, drinks, anything, like with a taste, a macular actually can taste it. I don't know what I've been doing the last four years. If I could actually taste or if everything was just kind of bland, but wow, taste of my food, pretty great. And for the cons, I have been evil, evil, evil, mean. Andrew will attest to that. I haven't been, I'm sure it's my hormones raging too, but I have been, like a little bit of catty. On the edge, push him button, you know, doing the things. Andrew's really putting up with me well. I don't know how. Thank you, Jesus, for my sweet man. Things that are making it a lot easier for me are minty gum. It's also helping with monogia, which I explained in my video last night. I'll link it below if you haven't watched it, but I have been really nauseous and haven't morning sickness. So the minty gum has been helping me there, but it's like a two birds, one stone situation because it's helping with the nicotine cramon as well. And then the minty lifesavers are also helping. I will keep you guys updated on how it goes and the nicotine no vape free life. Hopefully it continues on even after baby comes, but we'll see.","Fashion accessory, Human mouth, Necklace, Human face, Clothing, Woman, Human hand, Girl, Person C, G, eganh, I, AM, Tik Tok, $73, Pregnancy Journey, J, O, i've flat out been a B***h, goaty, >, ea0, 203, tting Vaping, A, THE, itting Vaping, AME, ecaun, C TikTok, OBD, o TikTok, i've flat out been a B**h, P, M, S, c TikTOk, 29801, d TikTok, -, 208D, f've flat out been a B***h, TikTok, PLM, d, @savannuhhb, c TikTok, C TIKTOK, 20acy, OIM, 1, eoath, d1, 2oat, V, B, CTikTok, TikTOk, T, g0abh, MM, 21, 20a0, Quitting Vaping"
7288502150395645227,"Drinking and other age restrictions in the US don’t make sense. If you are old enough to get married, go to war, and have children, you should be old enough to have a beer and/or tobacco.  #legaldrinkingage #drinking #smoking #laws #government #parenting #motherhood #momlife #thoughts #ideas "," drinking ages are completely arbitrary. And I travel a lot and this opened my mind to many, many things. But when my son turned 18, we went on a family vacation to Mexico and he actually got to have his first legal drink out of the country because the laws are different there. And it was a really cool thing for him because we went into a restaurant and he's like, can I order a drink? And I'm like, well, you're 18. I order a drink in Mexico. It's legal. So he did. And then we came home from vacation and he's 18, not 21. So it's not legal for him to drink here. And this turned into this whole process in my mind where I thought, okay, so I live in a country where my son is 18. You know, he's old enough to get married. He's old enough to go to war. Certainly old enough to produce children. But according to our government, he's not old enough to buy a cigarette or a vape or have a beer, which made no sense to me. And I had this whole conversation with my class last week because one of my students was about to turn 21 and he said, I've been waiting years to drink. And I told him about my experiences traveling and how ridiculous I think that is because all you have to do really to get into a place where it's legal is leave the country, go somewhere else, you know, go to another state, you can buy marijuana. It's just, it's just so stupid. And I think that should change. We need to decide what an adult is, whether it's 18, 21, you know, because it's all ridiculous, your brain's not fully formed to your 26 anyway. And just roll with that, right?

This is a great question because she makes a lot of great points that marijuana is being legalized in a lot of places and there's not a lot of great data on marijuana and pregnancy. But there are a few things that we do know, so let's talk about it. Number one, THC is a small molecule and does cross the placenta, so babies are exposed to it. Number two, the fetal brain starts expressing cannaboeid receptors as early as 14 weeks, so there may be a purpose in neural development. Number three, marijuana and pregnancy is really hard to study because there's lots of confounding factors, so there has been some mixed results. One of the larger newer studies have shown an increased risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, and new and newndal death. One study even showed an increased risk of GI abnormalities. Bottom line, the American College of OBGYN recognizes that there's not a whole lot of data, but they still recommend against it.",

7267998639346224430,Idk why my hands are so shaky lol #greenscreen ," I hid my second pregnancy the entire 41 weeks and then popped out with a baby. So here's some posts that I made when I was hiding my pregnancy. So starting off with my most impressive one, this was June 4th. So I was two days over my due day. I was 40 weeks in today's pregnant. And I just laid with my son in a way that unless you were zooming in on every angle of my picture, you were not going to notice that I was 40 weeks in today's pregnant. This one I was over eight months pregnant. And I just had my sister hop in front of me for the pictures that were going to be posted because there was no hiding my bump anymore at this point. I had to have something or someone in front of me. I was about six months pregnant in this one. So I did have a bump. The lean over with the big coat covered it and the cute boy with skate sand is what I figured people would most focus on. My son had long hair until Valentine's Day of last year. So I posted this picture when people started rumors were swirling that old balers pregnant. I posted this picture and I had I posted where my son had his hat on so that you couldn't see that he still had his long hair. This was actually from months before I was pregnant. But nobody knows. So I posted this one so that people would stop assuming that I was pregnant. This is Easter and this is actually when my family found out I was pregnant because I didn't announce it to anyone. I just showed up to Easter with a baby bump. I placed him on my hip in a way that his leg covered where my stomach stuck out and moved like curved my hips so that I wasn't completely sideways and you couldn't see the whole bump. Granted I was pretty small still at this point, but I definitely still look pregnant. This was my friend's birthday. We went out to eat and Olivia and Carly both posted really cute pictures of them by this lake area here and I was the only one who didn't. So I posted this picture of all three of us, four of us if you count Celi, so that nobody would start to question why I wasn't posting pictures when everyone else was. And I know that sounds like kind of crazy, but I promise you people were like on my case about if I was pregnant or not. And then on June 8th, 40 weeks and six days pregnant, I posted this and announced my pregnancy on Facebook and Instagram and every single comment was Oh my God, I had no idea. Oh my God, I didn't know. 10 out of 10 recommend hiding your pregnancy if you want to pull a Kylie Jenner and just not deal with what everybody has to think and say about you being pregnant.","Car, Handbag, Fashion accessory, Power plugs and sockets, Mobile Phone, Tie, Necklace, Human face, Woman, Clothing, Boy, Hat, Girl, Footwear, Person hers, View all 52 comments, baylormccutc, Highlight, fandcomo boy, Liked by suzymccutc, View insig, C TikTo, Normccutch, of you big brother.

This will be my first pregnancy me and my husband. We are expecting our first child hopefully. Fingers crossed that everything goes well and everything is good. So yeah we have that doctor's appointment tomorrow to make sure everything is good. Confirm the pregnancy, get set up with an OBGYN, all that kind of stuff. So we're going so I'm currently going through that right now. That is why I'm quitting vaping because I'm pregnant and I do not want to have put any chemicals in my body while I'm pregnant. You know just a risk of hurting my child or anything like that. So we're quitting. Today is day one. I haven't vaped this morning at all. It's 10 o'clock. I feel okay. I'm not feeling any cravings.

But what came out a lot was people wondering about what second-hand smoke is, what third-hand smoke is, and there was a lot of misconception about whether or not vaping was more or less dangerous. Let me be clear, I'm going to post a video montage, I want you to pause on each slide and actually read what it says so that you're clear about the message I'm trying to send in terms of helping you be educated to protect you and your baby. But I want to be clear, the reason I believe vaping is more dangerous, aside from the ways that the CO2 canisters affect your lungs much more aggressively, is because it's misleading. We can't smell it as smoke and it often smells sweet. So we think that there's nothing wrong, the vapor is equally dangerous. Please understand that I am not placing any judgment on anyone for whatever habits that you have.

According to this meta-analysis, pregnant women who were exposed to second-hand smoke were 23% more likely to experience stillbirth and 13% more likely to have a child with birth defects. Besides that, another meta-analysis found that past smoke and due pregnancies associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects, which are basically defects of the brain, spine, or the spinal cord.

That your babies being exposed to second hand smoke when you smoke in the close proximity to them and if you don't smoke around them but you come in after vaping and you hold their hands you cover them close you hug them it's all over your skin and your clothes. So you are exposing your baby to those toxins and I know you don't mean to and I know you're not trying to hurt your child unfortunately you are and that's the problem. So you may not want to quit but I strongly encourage you to at the very least bathe and wash your hands and change your clothes before you snuggle in.,
7222722078649142533,Prepare your body for pregnancy. #fertility #pregnancy #fertilityjourney #motherhood #manifesting #motheranddaughter ," Here's how you can prepare your body for pregnancy. At least six months before your attempt to try to get pregnant, quit these following things. Alcohol, weed, tobacco, vaping, anything that has to do with smoking or inhaling something. Coffee, because coffee dries a digestion and we need lubrication in the body. Try cocoa or a dandelion blend. You can also add some collagen to your drinks in the morning and a bit of coconut oil. And tea. Tea is really good. Try something very gentle, some camel milk, some peppermint, avoid green tea or matcha. They are also very dry. Anything that is very high in caffeine can have a dry effect on your digestion. Avoid processed foods, processed sugars. Fast food should also be off the list completely. Stick to whole foods. Eat really good protein. If you can cook it at home, that's even better. It's safe to eat a lot of tofu if you're vegan. If you are vegetarian or you just eat fish, fish is really amazing. And no matter what your diet is, I think increasing fish before pregnancy and even during. I was eating fish around three, four times a week. I was craving it because I'm a vegetarian. I was a vegetarian and I didn't eat fish for a long time, but my body started craving fish. So the thing is you're going to start having cravings before getting pregnant. Your body can tell you, if you turn into your body, it's going to tell you, hey, I'm going to need more of this nutrient or dad nutrient because it takes the body a lot to make a baby and to keep the baby and to have a safe pregnancy and to deliver safely. So this is just like the basic requirement for your body to be in its best health. Now for exercise. I think it depends, it's case by case, but I would recommend going for walks every day if you can, at least an hour's being with yourself breathing very deeply and working on your posture and the pelvis, how you hold your pelvis. See if you have an inferior tail or an exterior tail. Yes, my love. Your posture is very important because your body is going to change and your hips are going to change. And if your posture and your pelvis are not in that good shape and you already have back pain, you're going to have a lot more. So it's good six months before that you really work on these key elements of your body, like the basic posturing and your diet. This is going to help a lot. And also managing your stress. Managing your stress is crucial. So stress management may be try breath exercises, try breathing deeply. Meditation, gentle yoga, anything they can help you feel good and make your body relax and try sleeping at least eight.",

Today I'm going to talk to you about how pregnancy can affect your gum health. During your pregnancy some women may find that their gums feel a little bit sensitive. They may notice some bleeding and that is caused by a change in hormones. Now what happens is your body is basically becoming hypersensitive to the presence of plaque. All you need to do in this situation is just make sure that you have a really good oral hygiene routine that includes brushing twice a day and also cleaning in between the teeth with either floss or interdental brushes. Now if you notice bleeding try not to be put off but actually keep going and keep cleaning. What you should notice is after a few days that bleeding starts to settle down. If you're not getting an improvement after a week or two then it would be best to come and see a dental hygienist who can provide you with a clean as well as tailored oral hygiene. After the baby has been born you should find that your gum start to go back to normal.,"Clock, Fashion accessory, Human face, Woman, Clothing, Wall Clock What's the pregnant sign ?, have a really g entaline, Semolomen may ni, 219, How do you know if a woman is pregnant?, becoming hypesie, A, between the tethelentalclinic, your body is basical, 8, if you tieadentalclinic, and also cleaning i TikTok, twice a day,, Iim going to taltqikTok, you're pregnant?, d TikTok, After the baby aseentalclinic, that bleeding arentalclinic, VOITX), BO, hygiene routine, about you 9, |, that includes bugentalclinic, All you need to dehintalclinic, Q, Now what happens is, an, r, ten it would be besto, situation, and that is cauenelayadentalclinic, T, lust make sure that o, 1-24 Reply, @chelseadentatlinrprising facts, I'm going to taltqikTok, ypur body is basical, you about how peatalclinic, They did with me it's how I found out I was, that includes bushigientalclinic, 2, eur body is basica, between the tethebentalclinic, Tik Tok, and that is causerelayadentalclinic, and keep cleaning., chelseadentalclinic, How do they know if there is a pregnancy, bleeding, But actually ke@ngiaentalclinic, Kala Razafi, DOAD, a clean as well as tailored, and that is causelyadentalclinic, you about how egatalclinic, TikTok, oral hygiene., How na denirleir e, If you're not getting, your body is basicalt, settle down., hygienist., During your pregnancy, But actually ke@ngaentalclinic, between the tetheentalclinic, bleeding,, after a few days, Can your dentist tell that, VOIT), that bleeding arsentalclinic, to the presence of plaque., bit sensitive., come and see taentaleline, you about how eatalclinic, 3.

7220792203738664219,," Free vapes are going to be handed out by the government as part of an anti-smoking drive, but is this the best way to go about it? The vapes will go out to 1 million smokers, which is about 1 in 5, as well as offers of behavioural support. It's part of the government's drive to get smoking rates in England below 5% by 2030. Now, in 2021, smoking prevails in England at about 13%. Health Minister Neil O'Brien is expected to say that the free-vate policy called SWAP to stop is going to be the first of its kind in the world. Also around 9% of women still smoke during pregnancy here in England, so they will also be offered up to £400 in shopping vouchers to stop smoking. The scheme in total is estimated to cost about £45 million. Just earlier this week, the government announced that it's setting up new enforcement to stop vates being sold illegally to under 18s. Overall, some critics are aware of this new scheme, given that the long-term effects of vaping are relatively unknown. Okay, so what do you think is SWAP to stop a good idea?",
7328467946454404395,"Telling my mom and dad we’re pregnant! Story time: This is one of my most favorite memories😭 We were in Chattanooga TN for our beautiful friend’s wedding! We had known I was pregnant for about a week before heading to Tennessee for the wedding weekend. I hadn’t seen my parents in a month, because they were at their place in North Carolina for the summer. So the wedding would be my first time seeing them in person since finding out! My mom and I talk every single day, so having to act normal and small talk on the phone for that week felt like a year😂 We got to our hotel around 9 pm on October 12th, and knew we wouldn’t see my parents until the next day. We got some sleep and woke up the next morning SO excited.  October 13th was the day of the welcome party for the wedding, and also happened to be our 4 year wedding anniversary (SO special🥺) We had a plan in place where we put together a “memory box” filled with paper products/memories from our wedding, so I could just tell my parents “look what Nate got me!” And it would be believable lol Really underneath all of the photos/memories in the box we had placed the positive pregnancy test, on top of two infant outfits my mom had bought me in July to give me hope for our future babe-so surreal we got to tell them like that🥺  Come time for the plan, they were making things extremely difficult, they wouldn’t come up to our hotel room!😂 Nate tried everything to convince them! Finally they said they would meet in our room, so we could walk over to the welcome party together.  The plan was on! I was so excited to tell them, I almost couldn’t handle it! They got up to the room, we chatted for a bit and then I pulled out the box to show them what “Nate got me for our anniversary”😂 and that’s where Nate started recording!  My favorite quotes include: “Is that a vape?” -My dad lol  “What an anniversary gifts that is holy $#!+” -My dad  And “I’m going to be a Grammy!

7242753149730163994,Have you ever come across a vape like this? #Vape #IllegalVape #Police #VapeLife #Durham #BBCNews," This might look like a toy, but it's actually an illegal vape, which was seized from a shop in County Durham. It's branded as a strawberry ice cream twistibar, which contains nicotine and has a tank size 10 times bigger than the 2 milliliter legal size. To put that into perspective, a legal vape has about 600 puffs, while this one goes up to 7000. Officials say they're particularly concerned about this product, which they say is made to look appealing to children and they say they will continue to seize illegal vapes from shops. And only last week the Prime Minister could be seen holding one of these milkshake-looking vapes during a visit to a loving Kent to watch vapes being tested. There he announced plans to crack down on vape marketing to prevent the targeting of children and teens, to close a loophole which allowed retailers to give free vapes samples to children and to make it easier to find shops selling illegal vapes. The plans however have been criticised by the opposition, who called it baby steps and said more action was needed.","Poster, Fashion accessory, Shirt, Human face, Clothing, Woman, Girl, Man d TikTOR, Concerns over illegal, Beic, 10.05.2023, 6.2, Durham County Council, UPBLISS, d TikTok, B C, BB, d TiKTOk, BC, Durbnm County Council, Posted on 10.06.202, B 8 C, TikTOk, TusTER, ANA GUERRA-MOORE, BBC, 202, :, Po, BAR, STRAW, c, ANA GUERRA-MOOR, d TikTOk, TNSTER, Source: Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, B B C, TikTok, B, Post, Kent, @bbcnews, Posted on 10.06.2, About 600, C TiKTOK, Maximum tank size, Posted on 10.06.2023, How to spot a legal vape, ICE C, @bbonews, BBC Journalist, o TikTok, 10ml, d TikTOK, TIGERS, t, a, Largest refill bottle volume, -, Highest nicotine strength, DnSTER, cTikTok, 20mg/ml (or 2%), on 10.06.2023, PIN, PINK, C, CnSTER, I, LEM, ICE, Posted on 10.0, J, milkshake-like vape, SULE, -uSTER, Total number of puffs, TICE, BLISS, Posted on 10.06., BINGO, d TiKTOK, DuSTER, f, S, 10.06.2023, ICEC, d, Posted, Poste, 2ml"

I posted this originally on Amity Ashole and had been told that this would fit perfectly here, since my aunt is the entitled parent. My husband and I are finally expecting our rainbow baby after years of infertility and multiple miscarriages. It's safe to say we and our family are very freaking excited. My mom is probably the most excited. She's been planning our baby shower and making decorations for months. She's been the biggest help during this exciting yet scary pregnancy. A few weeks ago, my aunt told my mother and I that my cousin is pregnant. We are very happy for her. However, my aunt said their plan is to announce her pregnancy at my baby shower, since we are having a big party anyways. She said it's not a big deal and we both can share the day. I said absolutely not because we have been waiting for this day forever and it should be all about me and my rainbow baby. My mother is on my side and told my aunt that they better not announce anything at the party. My aunt dropped it and nothing else was said. Last Saturday was my baby shower. It was everything I've waited for. Everything is going good. No one has announced my cousin's pregnancy. When it was time for us to eat my cake, my aunt said, hold on, hold on everyone and went out.","Flower, Book, Mobile Phone, Strawberry, Bottle, Desk, Headphones, Laptop, Balloon, Woman, Clothing, Candy, Human face, Bread, Person 0000, NO ONE HAS ANNOUNCED MY COUSIN'S, down rightnow, had to gotoiss, WHEN IT WAS TIME FOR US TO EAT MY, DAUGHTER'S PREGNANCY, solwas pretty glad that, and the nextdaystarted, so he had three days of, NOT ANNOUNCE ANYTHING AT THE PARTY., VES, EVERYONE, AND MAKING DECORATIONS FOR, myfriend forone day, FOREVER AND IT SHOULD BE ALL ABOUT ME, EXCITED., @mdnh, MY AUNT SAID, ANYWAYS, we wenthome, definitely would have gotte, ABSOLUTELY NOT, AND HAD BEEN TOLD THAT THIS WOULD FIT, MY AUNT TOLD MY, because outofschool, AT MY BABY SHOWER FOR MY RAINBOW, d TikTok, and then the school police, my friend for one day, yougetthree days of iss, and then after that, we wentto ournext, nd we both were in theref, c TikTok, I'm like noldon'tit's, instead ofthree, one dayofiss, it starts the.nextday, VEL AI, A FEW WEEKS AGO, MY MOTHER IS ON MY SIDE AND TOLD MY, HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS DAY, gooot, LAST SATURDAY WAS MY BABY SHOWER., Tik Tok, MY AUNT SAID THEIR PLAN IS TO, downright now, WE ARE VERY HAPPY FOR HER.

Just saying. Like because we- I feel like we just need a little bit of common sense in this discussion. Let's ignore the research on THC impregnancy because the truth is it is difficult to conduct this research. And let's just start with a minimal amount of facts. Number one, we know that THC crosses the placenta and gets into baby's bloodstream. Okay? Number two, we know that once in baby's bloodstream that it then gets into the brain, it crosses what we call the blood brain barrier. Not all substances do that. THC does. Now, I want you to think about your own experiences with THC. Oh, just- I'll just share mine. I think the one word that I could use to summarize is the effect of THC on my brain is it just makes my thought processes a little bit slower. I'm just a little stupider. Just a little, you know?

7215759122820500742,🍃 During Pregnancy #fyp #education #hyperemesisgravidarum #pregnantstarvingmoms #greenscreen ," Okay, H.D. Moms, I think I came to a new conclusion, slash viewpoint slash opinion, about the green plant and hyper-Mrs. Scribdram. I used THC through the form of smoking during my H.D. pregnancy because it was the fastest method of available to me. Remember, lacked some knowledge, but I think the next closest thing to smoking that gets into your system super fast is repositories, I am gonna check that out though. Next time, I have H, if I get HG again, I'm trying those. They're on the market here in Alberta for menstrual cramps. I maybe they can work for HG. So, this brings me to my point. I got message saying this. This mom doesn't have HG, she just uses cannabis to deal with some stuff going on in her brain. Okay, so my message is this, I don't think you should be smoking the green plant during your pregnancy. I think that you should consume it in a different way. And I think that best way would be probably edibles. Hey, if CBD edibles work for you, that's fantastic. But I know sometimes the THC is what helped a lot of moms for certain things. So, you might have to look for a gummy or something like that in THC. The reason I don't agree with you smoking is that you don't need that relief super super fast. You can be on a more of a schedule. As a HG mom, I had no choice. My puking had a mind of its own. And so I had to get relief very fast because I was so, so, so sick and I needed to eat. Now, since my pregnancy, I have learned a lot of things such as using a hempwik is the best way to go during pregnancy. But for yourself, I don't even recommend that. Combustion is just not something you want to be doing during pregnancy if you can. Sometimes for HG moms, it's just this is the only way. I'm trying to gather people's stories about, you know, different methods of consumption that they use. So some moms have had some HG moms have had success with edibles, but not a lot. Some moms have had success with tinketers, but not a lot. And so the list kind of goes on and on with that. And so the more that we can offer like different examples like, okay, try this, try this, try this, try this, until, and then if all of that doesn't work, then you try smoking. But for someone who doesn't have HG, it's not as life threatening, it's not as serious, because you're not cyclically vomiting every one to three hours. Then that's when you do have to scale back. You need to look at your options and see what is going to be best for you and baby. For HG, the negatives of malnutrition are so, so bad. And so any negatives that kind of come with that combustion that I talked about, it's a relatively low risk when it comes to that compared to starving.","Poster, Human face, Woman, Clothing, Girl, Jacket so so sick and I needed to eat, brain, probably edibles, Consumption during, gummy or something like that in, Store, p, slash viewpoint slash opinion, @goldenteachertori, method of available to me, I'm trying those, repl, I take, pregre saying this, d of, replac, am gonna check that out though, try this try this, It, What doeshelp you with, OTikTOk, hey if C bee D edibles work for, some HG moms have had success, I take medic, with tinctures, different methods of, c TikTok, I don't think you should be, Mentally is what I, before I got pregnantsnt have HG, and then if all of that doesn't work, but I think the next closest thing, with edibles, oTikTok, @GoldenTeacherator, Like do you use it instead of, you need to look at your options, okay so my message is this, so some moms have had, se it for, instead of, and so any negatives that kinda, you know different, sm0Oking the green plant during, vomitting every one to 3 hours, CikTok, but I know sometimes the is what, and so the list kind of goes on and, so this brings me to my point, I take medication it's not in, during pregnancy?, combustion is just not something, in a different way, C TikTok, TIKTO, you don't need that relief super, such as using a hempwork is the, d Tik O, pregnancy, because it was the fastest, but for yourself I don't even, my puking had a mind of its own, @ Store, help you with, C TikTOk, some moms have had success, recommend that, stead of, TikTok, best way to go during pregnancy, I take n, @coldenTeacheratori, J TikTok, Learned a lot of things, Mentally is what I use it for, next time I have a if I get HG again, Hyperemesis Gravidarum, for HG all the negatives of, and so the more that we can offer, moms it's just the only way, try this until, and so I had to get relief very fast, replacemer, Mentally is, you want to be doing during, Egoing on in her, before I got pregnant, I take m, O TikTok, @goldenteachertor, you that's fantastic, about the green plant and, you can be on a more like of a, Mentall, of smoking during my HG, remember lacks knowledge, use it instead of, I take med, before ggt regan going on in her, because I was so, your pregnancy, things, OTikTok, o TikTok, @GoldenTeacheratori, it instead of, Menta, it's not as serious, What does, nd a, smOOking the green plant during, because you're not cyclically, a, on with that, come with that combustion that I, I'm trying to gather people stories, about, Mentally is wh, for, talked about, I'm not Ijust wes adaily smekerdea, CTiKTok, but for someone who doesn't have, Ithink I came to a new conclusion, rer, pree saying this, then you try smoking, before I got, Alberta for menstrual cramps, Mentally is w, Mentally is wha, pills?, Pregnancy, e it instead of, nd a message, going on in her, I maybe they can work for HG, it's it's a relatively low risk when it, I tak, I'm not I just was a daily smoker, before Igot pregnant, replacer, I think that you should consume it, and I think that best way would be, I, replacement of anything, I used Tee H Cee through the form, like different examples, Iused Tee H Cee through the form, HG, J, comes to that, that gets into your system super, the reason I don't agree with you, helped a lot moms for certain, but not a lot, if you can sometimes for HG, as a HG mom I had no choice, you do have to scale back, smoking is that you don't, How much are you puking?, ikTok, and see what is going to be best, for you and baby, fast is suppositories, I am gonna check that out though, Mentally is V, to sm0Oking, malnutrition are so so bad, I'm not Ijustwes adaily smekerdea, Follow me on Instagram, now since my pregnancy I've, TikTo, they're on the market here in, super fast, replace, hey if Cbee D edibles work for, schedule, it's not as life threatening, so you might have to look for a, Lil, nstead of, um then that's when you you, like okay try this, consumption that they use, @go.enteachertori, cikTo, CTikTok, L, re"

7332084704604196129,#pregnant #pregnantlife #pregnanttiktok ," severe sickness in pregnancy, HG, hyperemesis, hyperemesis, Gavadaram is something that I'm really passionate about, talking about and how it actually really can be so awful because I had it during my second pregnancy. First pregnancy was absolutely fine. I had sickness right up until I was about 20 weeks but I would only throw a perennarne again. This sickness was of a different kind with my second pregnancy. I had to quit work, I had to get family members to come and do the school run for me for my eldest. It was just horrendous. I couldn't even lift my head off the pillow. I considered terminating my pregnancy at various points. I had to go into hospital to A&E and get put on a drip. I was so, so unwell. I ended up having to have, I think it was six injections. I had to have an injection every week or so for B12 to help me just feel half decent. I mean, I struggled so bad financially because I've had to quit my job during my pregnancy as well. It was just an awful time and I always thought that it was just, oh, it's morning sickness. That's what that is. But for some women, it can be so detrimental to their pregnancy and their mental health. I suffered so bad with depression during my pregnancy because of this. So anyone that is spreading awareness for pregnancy sickness, I'm all for. If this is something you've been through, please let me know because I'd love to kind of share it and let people know what it's really like and how bad it really can be, because it's not just morning sickness, it is like having the flu. For up to three months, sometimes even longer, it is rude-desher and tool-to-eumental health.","Human face, Woman, Clothing SICKNESS IN, SICKNESS. IT IS, CAN BE SO, ENDED UP, ON A, THIS.

7300226999870606625,Quit smoking when you‘re pregnant #pregnanttiktok #tips4moms ," a great idea to quit smoking before you get pregnant, but if you are pregnant and find that you are still smoking, now is a great time to stop. Smoking has been linked to vaginal bleeding, preterm birth, small for gestational age infants, as well as stillbirth and sudden infant death syndrome. Smoking quitting smoking is the number one thing you could do for your health and your baby's health. Another really important thing to avoid is alcohol.

Yeah. Real cute. Wonder what my fucking lungs look like. Don't know how my teeth are still like this. But I love cigarettes. I love them. If you've been following me for a long time, you know that a good new poor, a good met menthol cigarette. But every time that I would try to quit smoking cigarettes, I would drink. So then when I drank, the fucking chains were off. I would go buy a pack of cigarettes or have one of my girls that were coming over. Somebody that was coming by, bring me a pack or I'd bum a couple, whatever. I could not be drinking and not smoke ever. So I knew that when I quit drinking, it was going to suck. It just had to really suck. So I was just gonna fucking do it all. There's no way that I could consciously feel good about not drinking and like trying to focus on my health. Because that was another huge thing with my sobriety. I just really wanted to be healthy. I was so tired of being a sloppy Joe. I just did it all together. I threw my jewel in the trash. I just didn't buy cigarettes. I chewed tons of cinnamon gum and I just didn't drink. I didn't smoke. Did it suck? It fucking sucked. Do you know what sucked the worst was getting rid of my vape? That was like crawling out of my skin. Because I had quit smoking before and I quit drinking before when I was pregnant. The smoking thing, I had done that for like a couple of months here and there before. But that was hard. The vape. But now that I don't smoke, I don't think about it. I'm 20 month smoke for you tomorrow. Alcohol free too. But it really does get easier. You guys just have to think that like you're forming these habits. You just have to form new habits. I do still to this day chew a shit ton of gum. I love gum.

I'd do it if you were trying to quit smoking, you want to do it without the idea of ending nicotine. But if for any reasons that is not possible, NAT is safe for you to use whilst pregnant and breastfeeding. Always check with you by Dr. Nurse Health Visitor. So, NAT is considered a lot safer than actually smoking. If you are pregnant, then stopping smoking is the single biggest thing that you can do.

7309681321603910955,Im sure this will hurt some feelings but oh well 🤷🏻‍♀️ #dowhatyouneedtodo #stopsmokingwhilepregnant #stepup #vaping #dobetterbebetter ," If you're pregnant and you're still smoking cigarettes or vaping, I am judging the fuck out of you. Like there's really no excuse, it's selfish as fuck and you're already failing. And don't even try to hit me with the, oh it's bad to quit cold turkey when you're pregnant because your child can go through withdrawals. I started smoking cigarettes when I was nine years old. I was a literal fucking child. As soon as I found out I was pregnant with my son, I quit. Because that's what you're supposed to do. And then we got all the older moms saying, Oh, well we used to smoke in the 80s and 90s and we were pregnant. Yeah, yeah, and look at most of us. We're fucking depressed and anxiety filled. And we have health issues. Wonder why. And same thing goes for if you're smoking cigarettes or vaping in your house around your children 24-7. Like, I'm judging the fuck out of you. And I'm not a judgemental mom at all. Like do what you want to do with your children. But if you're putting them in harm's way, I'm gonna judge you. And I'm gonna have my opinion and it's not gonna be a nice one. You can go nine months without a vape or a cigarette. And you can go outside to hit your vape or smoke your cigarette. You don't have to do it in front of your children. And I'm only bringing this up because I see it being a fucking trend. I see so many pregnant women on this app vaping and nobody says anything about it. They don't care. Like, I understand that it's not your body and it's not your baby, but like, it's not okay and we shouldn't normalize it. And I'm not talking about smoke and Mary Jane. That's actually beneficial during pregnancy and it's a lot safer than a lot of the medications that doctors try to put women on while they're pregnant. But tobacco, nicotine products have so many harsh chemicals. It is literally horrible for you. And I'm a vapor myself. I have nothing against it. I used to also smoke for years and years and years. I started smoking when I was a child. When you have kids, you put them first always. And I feel the same way about other types of users. I have no sympathy for you. I don't. Do what you need to do for your children.","Human face, Clothing, Woman, Girl 2, @omgnicole, & TikTok, d TikTok, O TikTok, for this but, C TikTok, I'll probably lose followers, TikTok, o TikTOk, o TikTok, dTikTok, @omgnicOle, I'lprobably lose followers, c TikTok, o TiKTOk"

7277704368743288110,my honest update but tbh i feel like shiiiiiit #greenscreen #quittingvaping #nicotine #quitnicotine #fyp ," Alright, today marks two weeks since I stopped baby. I touched, hit a baby, nothing in two weeks. Just the longest I've ever gone. We're fully committed to quitting, but I'm gonna give you all an update on my withdrawals and thumbs and side effects and all that stuff. Has it been easy? No, but it's more or less because I've had the worst withdrawals in thumbs ever and everyone that you look up on Google I have. But the cravings go away after the fifth day. I haven't had any cravings. I haven't been happy to like pop some gum or suckers anymore. The only time I really wanted headed was when I was stressed with moving on Friday and that was the first time I had a craving since like last week. Okay, these are the symptoms that they say you can have. Urges or cravings for nicotine is the most common symptom. I had that literally like, like I said, the first week max. Headaches so bad. Like the worst headaches I've ever experienced in my life. Nausea, yeah, and like fatigue, dizziness, depends. Feeling anxious, jumpy, irritable, grouchy, or angry. My anxiety has gotten much worse now that I don't have like my vapes to hit, but I feel like that's only gonna be temporary. Feeling frustrated, stuttered, depressed, always. Trouble sleeping, yes and no, depends on the day, but some days I get the lid really cannot fall asleep. Trouble concentrating. The first couple days I have my head was like so brain foggy. Like I didn't know what I was saying. Tired restless or bored, tired 100% like I'm so freaking tired, like worse than ever. Increased appetite, no, like I had no appetite. Like I got my appetite back literally yesterday. I was eating like one meal for like two weeks straight and that's probably why I felt sick. But like I literally was so notches I could not eat. Constipation, gas or that, you know, you guys know I have IBS so you guys can assume that one. Hot cough, dry mouth, sore throat, and nasal drip. No, I will say I, my throat hurt for a couple days like recently and I was sneezing, but I didn't have the rest of that. And chest tightness, oh my god, I literally thought I was in the ER because my chest hurts so bad. So has it been fun for me to quit? No, I've hated every second of this and sometimes I just think that like it'd be better if I just kept doing it, but I keep telling myself in the long run, like in the next two weeks it'll be a month and I'm like, all right, maybe it'll be worth it. So right now I literally don't see a difference other than I literally feel like dog shit and I'm so tired and everything just sucks right now. Like there's literally no improvement of anything. Like honestly, I feel so like so shined. But I just need a reality guys. Hopefully in the next two weeks things will turn out and like get better, but we'll see. We're, so that's not too extra on though. You're probably gonna be like wondering why I just so hit one then if it's so shitty. I'm like committed to quitting and I'm like, I'm only thinking like it's gonna get better eventually. So yeah, quit, I don't know what the positive side is yet, but just quit.",

7271552041959329057,"Robin Williams’ unexpected death on August 11, 2014 brought to an end the comedian’s long battle with cocaine and alcohol addiction. Williams checked himself in to a renewal center, but his battle with addiction dated back more than 30 years. He struggled with cocaine and alcohol abuse in the early ’80s, after his rise to fame on Mork & Mindy. “Cocaine for me was a place to hide. Most people get hyper on coke. It slowed me down,” Williams told People in 1988. Williams was even with John Belushi during the Saturday Night Live star’s all-night cocaine and heroin binge that led to his fatal overdose. Belushi’s death and Williams’ then-wife Valerie’s pregnancy with the couple’s son, Zak, forced the comedian to quit cocaine and alcohol cold turkey. “The Belushi tragedy was frightening,” Williams told People. “His death scared a whole group of show-business people. It caused a big exodus from drugs. And for me, there was the baby coming. I knew I couldn’t be a father and live that sort of life.” #robinwilliams #robinwilliamstribute #alcoholic #recoveryispossible #recoverytok #recoverycoach #stopsmokingcoach "," You know, it's an alcoholic I talk about, you know, some warning signs, you know, like DUIs and a cul-de-sac, things like that. The idea of, you know, have you been through it to talk about it and see, you know, this is what you go through, heart surgery, you know, alcohol. So I went to rehab in wine country just to keep my options open. And the idea of, you know, there's the things you got to talk about. What do you have? You got your own vineyard. Oh yes, that's like Gandhi owning a delicate vessel. You know, what do you do? This is not for my consumption. So you were dry for 20 years. Yes. Why did you fall off? I was in a little town in Alaska, wasn't the end of the world, but you can see it from there. You know, it was like all of a sudden I thought, I could drink. It's also that same thought you have if you look off a large building and go, I can fly. And within a week it was like, you know, gone. And now, you know, I realize I can't. So that was the gift, you know. How vividly can you remember falling into the trap in the first place was Kerkain and alcohol? I don't vividly remember anything from that. It's like there is this thing for alcoholics called a blackout, which isn't really a blackout. It's more like sleepwalking with activities. And I believe it's your conscience going into a witness protection program going, we're about to have sex with a hobbit. I've got to go now. Good luck. I'm checking out. I'm leaving the body on. We're not going to remember anything. Good luck to you, Taki. But do you remember getting into it? Getting into it? No, I remember the whole thing. It was very gradual. This is fun. And you're off. You know, you're off and running. And then the alcohol kicked in the side and then eventually realized I can't. I remember starving it on my own because I was about to have a son. And I didn't want to be cooked up going, hey, dad loves you. Here's a little switch. I'm going to throw up on you. You know, you don't want to be like that. And I had to kind of go, but I did it alone. So that was why it was, you know, 20 years without any help. Of course there are people who would say, what did you have in the Kerkain? Yeah, it's a bit redundant. You're as fast without it as the heaviest Kerkain any. Yeah, yeah, it's a weird thing. But I think I did it because it would actually allow me not to talk. It was like, you know, reverse medication. You know, why they give riddling hyperactive children is that idea of kind. Oh, okay, I don't have to talk to people. I kind of shut you down. Which is the word self-medication. And I've read that you've written John Belushi's this from an overdose. That scares me. I've been in a real show for a while. Totally. But more importantly, my son, I think that was the beginning of kind of, you know, thinking outside the box of, you've got a responsibility. It's more than you. How hard was it to break the grip of the second child around? I'm not hard once you go to rehab. I mean, real happy. Yeah, that's the beginning of kind of, you know, the ideas you got to surrender. You got to just say, I can't do it because, you know, I went to rehab with a lot of doctors and psychiatrists. And the more intelligent you think you are, the harder just to let go. I think I've got a solution. I was just drinking a little bit. It's like saying, I'll just partially circumsise myself. I'll be fine. And then you have to go, no, you lose. You can't do it. You need help. And at that point, that's the beginning. And then, you know, once you do that, you're out and running.",

Guys, I have good news. Most of my virtual telehealth practices set up based on the different things that I have discussed with you guys. Therefore, we do have a vaping cessation program. When it comes down to pregnancy, I would definitely be working along with your OBGYN just to make sure everything we're doing, your doctor approves of. If you want to have some more information on it, just click on the link in my bio and go down to where it says mailing list. I think there may be a comment or something like that. Put it in the interest of vaping cessation. I will check it and I will get right back with you. Guys, we can do this. Okay, I love you guys. I'm here for you. Let's stop vaping.",

So far I've wanted to nap about four times today. I've been craving a banana split for the last three fucking hours. For the last five hours I've done nothing but smell strawberries. I've been in my car. I've been through several hundred fucking miles of land today. There's no way there's strawberries growing everywhere. So for today I've eaten nachos. I've got two bags of candy sitting next to me and I'm gonna go home and eat some fucking board chops. Maybe with some eggs. I don't know. We'll see what there is to fucking cook it with. But yeah, I feel like a fucking pregnant woman with a bunch of fucking cravings. I want to sleep all the goddamn time.

7205275644085767470,"7 Things to Avoid When Trying to Get Pregnant, with Dr. Marc Sklar, DACM, LAc (@thefertilityexpert): 1. Smoking: Research shows that both women and men who smoke are significantly more likely to be infertile than those who don’t. 2. Consuming more than two drinks per day: While you don’t have to give up your favorite cocktail if you’re trying to get pregnant, it’s definitely advisable to slow down. 3. Drinking too much caffeine: Try to keep it under 200 mg (or two cups of coffee) per day, if possible. 4. Chronic Stress: Don’t forget to take care of yourself – mind, body, and spirit – during this time. It can actually improve your chances of conceiving! 5. Low-Quality Prenatal Supplements: FH PRO for Men and FH PRO for Women by @fairhavenhealth are premium fertility supplements with more than 25 essential ingredients, including antioxidants and micronutrients.* 6. Sperm-Harming Lubricants: BabyDance by Fairhaven Health undergoes rigid testing to ensure it won’t damage sperm, eggs, or the embryo. It’s a win-win! 7. Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals: Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs), which can be found in many personal care products, can ravage our hormones, and in some cases, cause infertility. For more information on quality supplements like FH PRO that can help support sperm and egg health*, head to the link in our bio or visit Fairhavenhealth.com. ✨ *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.  #fertilityrescripted #fertility  #fertilityawareness #fertilitysupport #fertilitytips #ttc #tryingtogetpregnant #tryingtogetpreggo #ttcjourney #fertilityjourney "," The seven things that you need to avoid to improve your fertility number one is smoking. Women are men who smoke have a much lower chance of conception, so quit it now. Alcohol consumption, I know many of you think that having two glasses of alcohol in a day is okay, but I say you need to have two in a week. Less is more in this situation. Caffeine, having no more than 200 milligrams or two cups of coffee in a day is okay. Caffeine can interrupt your hormones and reduce your chance of conception. Chronic stress is no good for any of us. We need to do a better job of avoiding stress and managing our mind, body, and spirit connection to improve our fertility. That's right. And so many of you are taking supplements, but low quality supplements are a no-go on this journey. We want to make sure you're getting the right nutrients to support your fertility. An FH Pro for men are exactly that. They are your full prenatals, full of all the right micronutrients and antioxidants to boost your fertility. Also, lubricants are really important and many of you are using lubricants, but are using the right one. Baby dance is toxin-free and water-based, which is exactly what you're looking for in a lubricant. We want to avoid those chemicals, which takes me to my last point, is getting rid of the endocrine disrupting chemicals in all your personal products and your beauty products.

6966275957309099270,," I'm gonna take full accountability right here and say, yes, I am a stupid parent for getting pregnant as being a smoker. Someone who depends on smoking, yes. I will say that first, but I'm also gonna take a second to educate you and help you better understand that withdraws cause a lot more damage in pregnancy than a plant. Again, a plant, a hemp plant, grown plant. That does not harm you. It is what's being smoked with it, the nicotine, the blunts, the backwoods. You can't have that during pregnancy. My doctor told me there is no research behind we physically harming a baby. Again, yes, I was terrible for being a dick. I guess I'm not addicted, but brilliance on weed, so young. And it was my fault I got pregnant so young, but I'm proud of the choices I took and I'm proud that I spoke to my doctor. So I could get this beautiful baby girl today.",

I only know that because I've an app that tracks it. But I have smoked pretty much for 20 years, except like when I was pregnant, but it's easy when you're carrying a baby, like, not to do it. Clearly, you're smoking is bad and you don't want to, because yeah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I know all that, but it's also very, very hard to quit. So, a friend of mine at work, we're like, hey, she's gonna want to quit. I'm gonna quit. Like, we're gonna do this together. She's like, let's take a champax, which I guess is, like, it's a pill, which I guess. Like, I take it. It's a pill and you take it twice a day. You get it from a prescription from your doctor, whatever. So, I've been taking that and it works and it curves your cravings. So, like, if you've ever wanted to quit smoking, and you always try to do it like cold turkey, like, which is what I've tried to do, and that doesn't work, this pill seems to be working. There's no cravings. The hardest part is, the getting used, like, I would get up in the morning, I'd have a coffee and I'd go outside and have a cigarette. So, like, I've stopped drinking coffee right now, which is probably why I'm really tired. Or, like, the afternoon, I always, like, two o'clock, I'd go out to work and have a cigarette. So, it's like trying to replace the routine of it. But otherwise, I feel pretty good, except that the tampax is mixing with the medication that I take for, like, anxiety and depression and ADHD, which I think is also why I am feeling so much more down than normal, which is why it's a lot harder for me to get out of this slump. But, like, at least I've recognized it, so it's good. And I'm forcing myself to, like, get up and do some stuff around the house. And then I get to go to the dentist. Yeah, so, anyways, there's no point to this. But I was gonna tell you, if you wanted to quit, I would highly recommend using tampax. It seems to work so far. I still want, like, you know, some people are still getting on my nerves, but overall, good report so far. I'll let you know in another four days. Or when I make it to day 10, I'll see. Hopefully, I've also eaten a lot because I was like, well, I could go and buy pack of cigarettes or I can get this thing of ice cream. And then I would just eat the whole thing of ice cream. So, once we've gotten that down, we've got to get back to eating healthy and not feeling like shit. Hey, that's all. Happy Friday.",

I was smoking probably from the age of 15. I stopped when I found out I was pregnant with you. I picked it back up again after you were like six months old or something like that. And then I finally quit just a couple of years before I had déjà. Really? Yeah, I was a smoker for a really long time. See, I can't even remember any memories of you smoking. Well, I never smoked in front of you. But I went through a lot of stages where I would try to quit. And I finally got to a point and I remember this. You were inside with dad and I was out in the back yard and I was having a cigarette and I was on the phone to one of my friends and he was like, what are you doing? And I was like, I'm just having a cigarette. And he's like, when are you going to quit? And I was like, I don't know why. And he's like, well, do you want to see Tisha's kids? And I was like, brah.

I've tried vapes, I've tried nicotine patches when I was pregnant. I tried cold turkey that just did not work for me. I'd give it a few days and I was back smoking. So and I've wanted to quit for a while. I have a kid now. We may not smoke at the house with her but second hand smoke is a fucking thing. And all around I'd probably end up spending more time with her than smoking. But I have tried one so far. And for me, trying to quit smoking, it's the oral fixation for me. So I'm hoping this will help with that. Probably update y'all on like a week and see how it goes. I'll also tag where I got them from if it's something that maybe y'all want to try or something.

I just had my last cigarette. I'm making this video to hold myself accountable because I have quit and restarted countless amount of times. I quit when I was pregnant, started back up due to stress, quit again, and then started back up because I only wanted to cigarette when I drank. And that never turns out good. I always end up smoking again. So yeah, this is my way of holding myself accountable and hoping that I stick with it this time. I don't want to be a smoker anymore. I personally don't want to smoke cigarettes. I don't want to have to feel like I need a smoke of cigarette. I don't want to resort to smoking when I'm stressed. Yeah, I just want better for my health. So I will be posting every single day that I am smoke free. I'm sorry if it gets annoying, but I'm hoping that this way I will actually... I don't know.

Have you tried to quit? Maybe you should quit. I would like you to live for a long time. I get enough of this from your grandmother. Listen, I don't need you to lecture me about my smoking. It's my problem. I will deal with it. I'm going to smoke for as long as I want to smoke. I'm going to live a long time. Don't you worry. I know that my smoking habit bothers you. And I know that you worry about me. I'm very sorry about that. Smoking is a coping mechanism for me. And although it's unhealthy and I probably should quit it, it's very difficult. But you can talk to me about it anytime. Although it would probably be healthier if you did quit smoking. That doesn't necessarily mean that you have to quit smoking because your kid worries about you. It does mean, however, that it would be beneficial for them and their development.

And I was gonna fix it and I was gonna like do all that shit, so I would look more presentable, but that would be fake. This is real life and this is like, this is your girl's journey day three. Okay, we're doing it. It's 11.30 right now. I gotta leave at 1.30 to go get the kids from school. They get out early every Friday. Perhaps take my meds, so let's do that before. That's probably why I'm so slow this morning. I don't know, it's weird. I feel like I'm going through a loop of emotions. I woke up this morning and had so much fucking energy. It was odd. I am not a morning person, but I was like singing and dancing. When I say good morning to my kids, seeing in the shower and like singing which I usually always do anyway, but I don't know. For like day three of quitting baby and I'm just, I'm not questioning it. I'm not. Let's take our meds because I'm a lot, I'm, I am all over the place right now. It's not, it's not good. Push in 30 and I still hate swallowing pills. That'll never fucking change. And I used to pop them for fun. Sorry, I'm sucking on a lifesaver also. You could never pay me enough money. It's a go-on buy. One of those Stanley Tumblr's like, no. Staying hydrated, but I just, I need another coffee. I don't care. Just trying to get through this. I feel like I'm a lot better today than I was yesterday, but I'm like still trying to reach for the vape. I don't know when that's going to go away. Coffee is ass. I still, I was really scared that my mental health was going to like tank after quitting baby. But honestly, my mental health has been so good this like past almost a year. So I'm, I feel okay. I don't feel like I'm going to fucking like die. You know what I'm saying? So I wanted to touch on my video where I talked about spending quality time with your kids and like putting their phone away. Both my kids had their parent-teacher conferences on Monday, and their teachers told me they shared with the class that their favorite thing to do when they're at home is spending time with their moms and playing games. And I just like wanted to cry. It's a little reminder that it does impact them more than we think it does. You're just told me that most kids will say like their favorite thing to do is, you know, play video games or whatever. I don't know. I just thought it was really sweet that my kids genuinely do love the little changes we've made in our house to make sure that they know that they're loved and that we get to spend quality time together. So with that being said, my kids are having a sleepover at their grandma's house this weekend. So your girl gets a night out. Apparently I'm coming out of retirement from the rave scene. I'm going to see extigin for like the 20th time. Thought my days of ravean were over, but we're gonna go have fun. I'm not gonna have a vape though, so I don't know. That will be its own update.",
7276541541391420714,Just a little #vlogger moment of #quittingnicotin after 9 years 🫣 as a #mamaof5kids #quittingvape #nicotinecheck #rawandreall #wishmeluck😳 #exsmokers #quittingbadhabits #onedayatatime #dontsmokekids #icandothis ," Okay guys, so I have had an abundance of people tell me how bad vaping is and like crazy stories of like friends like having aneurysms and being on like a breathing machine and being like worse off than they would if they would have just continued to smoke. So back story, I started smoking when I was like 21 years old, dumb, dumb decision, so dumb. It is what it is, can't beat myself up for it. I quit smoking two, well almost three years ago when I got pregnant with Murphy and I went over to a vape. And I've been vaping for three years, okay? So I got on the vape to quit smoking. Well now all these stories are coming out about it being worse for you than cigarettes. So I'm trying to figure it out, okay? I'm trying to figure out how to drop it all together because I'm really sick of spending money on it. I don't really enjoy it. That's actually why I actually do enjoy it. But I'm trying to tell myself I don't, okay? Because I know it's horrible. So I let Whitley throw all my vapes away today and um, the backpack of smokes. I'm going to wean myself down. Because with the cigarettes I don't want them, so I feel like it'll be easier to come off of it. Whereas with vapes I want it and I don't want to wean off of it. You know what I mean? It's like I have them in the house. And I really think these taste awful and they stink and it makes me feel like trash. So my hope is that I will be easier to eventually like cut it all out. So like six, five, four, three, two, one, done. Good. Kind of thing. Anyway, if you have a better option, let me know. Because why ever thought this was breaking cute is beyond me. It was not worth losing weight. It actually didn't even make me lose weight. But I'm like, am I in the mental state to cut myself off of nicotine five kids deep? I don't know. I don't freaking know. Here's your sign. Don't ever start. I've also been like praying that God gives me the strength not to take my habit away because it was my choice to do the habit was my choice to continue the habit is my choice also to get the habit up. I saw someone post that the other day and that was like a beautiful thing because it's like it's so relatable and so it makes so much sense like why we like pray for things to happen. And they don't happen is because it's like we have to do the work right. Like God didn't make me pick up a cigarette and start smoking it. However many years ago, like almost 10 years ago. Oh my gosh. I'm old. Anyway, just for strength and for discipline. And I think that I quit a lot of things. I quit drugs. I've quit an eating disorder. I quit battery relationships. I can do this. I can do this. Made of strong shit. And now I taste awful. So I'm gonna go brush my teeth and wash my hands. I'm gonna get real sick of this.",

It was a lot of comments So I couldn't comment back to everybody and then I had failed asleep. So here I am. Okay, so CPS is different in each day Never I live in Louisiana. I live in Alexandria, Louisiana. I smoked with my three year old The whole entire pregnancy. I smoked the morning. I was even supposed to give birth and I didn't even know I was supposed to give birth I went in for a stress test. I Went in to get Evaluate then in an ultrasound and they found out that he wrapped it up in the bill Concord and went ahead and took them out. That was at 35 weeks 35 weeks and one day They never never never never said anything about taking my baby Throughout my whole pregnancy, I went to my Obgy and to get my my monthly and every two week ultrasound and It was fine. I literally pee for him and I was dirty each time The most he did was gave me a pamphlet on how to stop smoking and that was all he did He didn't say stop smoking you didn't say none of that because he knew with Jonah I couldn't eat it all with this baby. I could eat every now and then I mean I'm only three months I've lost 21 pounds so far. I was one I was like 140 something when I got pregnant and I'm like 127 so I lost almost 20 pounds with this pregnancy But he said if I don't pick up when I'm 20 at least 20 weeks I only 13 weeks right now so he said if I don't pick up once I make 20 weeks He will try to go a different route maybe give me something to help me eat or he may just give me a week cord Let me go buy some weed so I can smoke and get high and you know Eat but yeah, I've been trying to eat to pick up weight though naturally because I really don't want to start smoking because I want to breastfeed This baby see but I see some people in the comments said they bet breastfed and smoked with a baby I just was so scared and paranoid. I would I wouldn't breastfeed John I wouldn't hit and buy the bottle fit my three year old So yeah, with this one. I just want to stop guys. It was no like I If it get too rough for me, I'm gonna start back. I'm not gonna lie. I'm gonna start back I don't care about none of these people in them comments Like this girl say it's Jesus real. Yeah, you blocked because what the fuck is you talking about? So yeah, I just want to address some of those comments. Yeah, I'm gonna be scared if you got now hard drugs I don't know about it. I Never took no hard drugs vaping. I stopped immediately I stopped immediately once he told me he can mess up my baby's heart I He just want to hit and stop vaping. I didn't want to vape anymore. No, no, no, no So the but that was giving me headaches and stuff too So once that calm down at the moment, I was like okay, I'm good on vaping I don't even feel the need to vape but when I was coupling with the vacant of the vaping with straws I was eating a lot of gum. So that will help you if you're a pregnant person and you're trying to stop vaping Try to eat gum and keep yourself occupied at the time you start thinning forward, you know Because I was a heavy smoker and I was a heavy vapor before I got pregnant So I just want to clear something that up but yes, some of the people in the comments I wouldn't even argue with them because at some point Just mind your fucking business","Fashion accessory, Human face, Woman, Boy, Clothing, Shorts, Swimwear, Human hand, Girl 2, O TikTok, I, stop for awhile, CA, Linmo, h, Tik Tok, nadt, C TiKTOK, >, :, J, CTikTOk, C Tiktok, C TikTok, F, CTikTOK, o TikTok, CTIKTOK, d TikTOk, stop for awhile _, P, t, C TikTOR, M, a, nefT, S, C TikTOk, c TikTOk, d TikTok, -, CTiKTOk, a TikTok, TikTok, @briannapearrie1, d, would take my baby, nal, Reply to .'s comment, c TikTok, C TIKTOK, AP, over weed.

Well you're gonna get two bottles of regular 16 ounce bottles of water and you're gonna pour the water out and pour the sunny-d into those bottles. You're gonna take one pack of Sirto and split it in between the bottles so put half and one bottle and half and other bottle. It doesn't have a taste. So you just pour it in, pour half and one and half and other. You drink that one the day before the drug test and then you drink the other one the night the night of the drug test. So drink one during the day, you drink one throughout the night and then that next day the day of your drug test you go ahead and get you a bottle of sunny-d and drink it all day and you know it helps. It cleared me out because I passed my drug test so yeah.",

7270160930753809706,Replying to @Ldybdy ," As a woman, here's now, seven months pregnant. I actually think about this a lot, and I would love to talk about it. I've been a very steady drinker and a continued user for probably like the last five years. And honestly, in probably like the year leading up to finding out I was pregnant, I was like drinking much more heavily than I ever have before. If you hear whining, he really wants me to play with him, but... Basically, the day I found out I was pregnant, I... It only took a couple hours for me and my boyfriend to decide that we wanted to keep this baby. And I had always looked for a reason to... Step, you know, change my lifestyle and stop the partying and drinking lifestyle, because I felt like dog shit every single day. And getting pregnant is no... That's no reason to get pregnant. You should never get pregnant because you want so sobriety motivation. But I will say, nothing I've ever tried has worked. I think mainly just out of like, if there was never like a reason for me to stop using nicotine and drinking so much, I was like, why would I? But so I really thought that it would be like much more difficult to quit everything cold turkey. But I think the like the second I decided I wanted to keep this baby, it really set in that like I don't want anything going wrong. And like, motherly instincts is definitely real. And I like feel a huge sense of responsibility over like the quality of life for... Because it is my responsibility. So yeah, basically the second I found out I was pregnant, I stopped everything. I would say like, it was hard for maybe like a week, just because everyone I'm around was... Not getting like fucked up, but you know like drinking casually and like hitting the jewel and stuff. And that was difficult for literally like a week. And now that it's been what like six months since I found out, I like can't even imagine even like when the baby comes, I can't say whether or not I'll like want to have a casual drink every once in a while, but I like to think that maybe I wouldn't because this is like the best I've ever felt in my life. And yeah, I think for you know, it's harder for some people. I'm not speaking for everyone. And like addiction is really real and valid, but for me, I think that like the second I found out it was just no question. And it hasn't been a problem for me at all. And I haven't had a single drink or any type of nicotine since then. It's a people are like, you can have a glass of wine here and there. I am on Medicaid and I can't, I'm not taking any risks. So also I have a midwife throughout this whole thing. I'm doing like a home birth situation. Don't care your opinion on that. But I started seeing her right when I found out I was pregnant as well. And so yeah, she has me on all kinds of shit like different vitamins and stuff and um, yeah, I think that just like once it's happening to you, everything is really real and like you don't even really feel for me at least. I don't even feel the need to be drinking or going out ever because something so much more important is happening.","Poster, Fashion accessory, Dog, Human face, Woman, Clothing, Girl, Picture frame @savage.scenequeen, O TikTok, Can you talk about how, I, scenequeen, J, C TiKTOK, etc, C TiKTOk, Reply to Ldybdy's comment, C TikTok, en, nic was knowing you, TiKTok, c TiKTOk, getting sober/quitting, o TikTok, d TiKTOK, d TikTOk, P, sober after giving birth, a, er, S, c TikTOk, C TikTOk, d TikTok, TikTo, were pregnant?

7222964744150469893,Pregnant women to be offered £400 to stop smoking! #pregnant #pregnancy #uk," Amongst the wider review of smoking in the UK, a move to offer pregnant women a financially incentive to quit has been proposed. A reported 9% of women smoke throughout their pregnancy in the UK, but this scheme will see them be offered up to £400 in shopping vouchers if they opt to stop smoking and can prove that they're afraid from smoking cigarettes with regular breath tests. The incentive would give them high street shopping vouchers in stages throughout their pregnancy. The wider review will also include almost one in five smogs in the UK being offered vague starter kits, although it has been acknowledged that vapes are not totally risk-free. They claim that the alternative of smoking is said to be far worse. Funding for the gain has been estimated to be costing the department of health and social care around £45 million over two years in a bid to make the nation smoke free. The measures were said to be welcome steps in the right direction, but still no way near sufficient.","Poster, Fashion accessory, Mobile Phone, Necklace, Human face, Woman, Clothing, Girl, Footwear ARE NOT, 19, THAT THEY'VE, 20, BUT STILLS, DIRECTION, VOUCHERS IN, 12 13 14 15, THEM HIGH, 4, ham.live, SUFFICIENT, FAR WORSE, PREGNANCY IN, 8, ESTIMATED TO, 7, ALMOST1 IN 5, NT, ngham.live, MAY, 23, APRIL, 25, CIGARETTES, Hnd Sur, d TikTok, HAS BEEN, 9, 29 30 31, WOULD GIVE, 14, VOUCHERS IF, 30, STAGES, ALSO INCLUDE, c TikTok, 2 3, THEIR, 17 18 19 20 21, .live, 26 27 28 29 30, A MOVE TO, RIGHT, THAT VAPES, WT F, THE UK BEING, MAKE THE, @birmingham.live, ALTHOUGH IT, WOMEN A, QUIT HAS BEEN, TOTALLY RISK, MEASURES, 2, SHOPPING, gham.live, THE INCENTIVE, IN A BID TO, REVIEW OF, STEPS IN THE, WIDER, £45 MILLION, 11, Curious?, THAT THE, C TikTok, 18, JBROPOSED, ngh, OVER 2 YEARS, ALMOST 1IN 5, 20 21 22 23, 24 25 26 27 28 29, A REPORTED, SMOKING IN, WITH, TO £400 IN, IS SAID TO BE, PROPOSED, TikTok, 16, 11 12 13, NATION, SMOKE, 9% OF WOMEN, THE WIDER, OFFER, THEY CLAIM, DEPARTMENT, SMOKE FREE, curious?, B, WERE SAID TQk, MARCH, SMT WT F, THROUGHOUT, REGULAR, Showtr ge, 15 16, SMOKING AND, 15 16 17 18 19 20, ALMOST 1 IN 5, PREGNANCY, O TikTok, OFFERED VAPE, 19 20 21 22 23, 12, nam.live, BE COSTING, THE UK, 6, SMT WT, THE, BEEN, KTok, FROM, FINANCIAL, CARE AROUND, NEAR, INCENTIVE TO, Kok, P, 24, 27 28 29 30, 3, -, ALTERNATIVE, Feelinge, COULD SEE, ACKNOWLEDGER, OFFERED UP, Follow @curiouslymedia for more, TI, FUNDING FOR, NOWHERE-, THAT VAPES9, SMTWTI, REVIEW WILL, AMONGST A, SCHEME, BE WELCOMED, I, Tok, J, WERE SAID TGk, NOWHERE"", 15, FEBRUARY, BUT THIS, AND SOCIAL, THEY OPT TO, SMOKING, SMOKERS IN, CAN PROVE, am.live, 17, THEM BEING, 5, STARTER KITS, F, 22, 13 14 15, 13, Feelingo, OF SMOKING, f, ikTok, SMTWTF, Umelive, BE WELCOMED"", 139, SCHEME HAS, S, STOP, er gel, TIKTOK, ALTHOU, 22 23 24 25 26 27 28, 1, BREATH TESS, ACKNOWLEDGED, PREGNANT, Feeling, REFRAINED, 21, 10, FREE, OF HEALTH"
7274987480770678058,Did you know that smoking has a huge impact on getting pregnant? #longervideos #hypnosis #hypnotherapistoftiktok #fertility #smoking #fertilitytips #quitsmokinghypnosis ," The best time to stop smoking was yesterday. The next best time to stop smoking is today. We all know smoking is not great for a number of reasons, but there's actually one that's important for women and men alike and that's fertility because smoking can have a really, really big impact on it. For women, smoking can cause irregular menstrual cycles, hormonal imbalances, ectopic pregnancies, a lot of things that are not great. For men, smoking affects from quality and quantity. Focusing is not an easy habit to break, which is why so many people are always saying, I'm gonna stop smoking, but then something stressful happens and then they revert back to smoking again. And there's a reason for that because for a lot of people, smoking is something that's comfort that brings them a constant in times of stress. And so there is a lot of re-riaring that needs to be done in your brain and also habits need to be shifted so you can revert to something else when life is stressful instead of smoking. But if you've tried to smoke many times and always failed, fear not because there is a natural solution for it, rooted in science that's called self-emnosis. Yes, you heard that right. Self-emnosis can change your self-conscious mind to change your habits and patterns to finally stop smoking for good.

7314045123963178282,Replying to @melaniewolak #smoking #pregnant #pregnancy #why #quit #smoke #respect #nicotine #addiction #sunsgodess ," I appreciate the way that this question was asked. I don't think it came from a place of disrespect or bullying. And I think this is the first time I've seen this type of question from a positive side. So I'm going to answer it. We smoked during pregnancy because nicotine is an addiction. It is an addiction that we've probably had, that most pregnant women have probably had for a very long time before we're becoming pregnant. We're thinking about pregnancy. Smoking is not easy. Just walk away from. I am looking into a support group, which I have an appointment for on Wednesday to see if that can help me maybe to quit a little bit quicker than what I'm already working on. But the biggest issue with nicotine, especially if you have other kids, and if you're the primary caretaker of those children is that right around day two or three, you become a royal bitch. Because nicotine is, that's your, I'm getting really bitchy. I'm getting really antsy. I'm going to freak out. You go smoke a cigarette. Come back in here. You're doing a million times better. So if you just up and quit cold turkey, you end up becoming a royal bitch, which is very unfair to your other children. And that can last for days or even weeks versus if you take the time to cut back. So I was smoking a little over half a pack a day six months ago, because I started this actually long before I got pregnant. And I've been cutting back and cutting back and cutting back. I was at just under half a pack a day a few months ago. And I cut back as much as I can. And I go back up, but I do track what I'm smoking, how often I'm smoking, that kind of stuff. It helps me to basically hold myself accountable for what I'm doing. But nicotine is a very difficult addiction to walk away from. There is not a lot of help to quit. The things that are supposed to help are usually a higher nicotine concentration than your body is used to. And therefore, can when you, if it doesn't work, you end up smoking more than you did prior to trying that thing. I've tried patches, I've tried lozenges, I've tried gum, I've tried all of that, it doesn't work. I need to cut back until I can quit. So that is my goal right now. That is what I'm working on. I appreciate the way that you stated this question. And no one would choose to smoke during pregnancy. It's literally an addiction. And we all do the best that we can. And I don't support smoking during pregnancy, but what I do support is that every mother has a right to just do her best. And if that means cutting back instead of quitting, then I'm going to do what I can to help her feel better about her choices. Because women need to support women period, no matter what your opinion is.",

It was because I was scared that I was going to give birth and then he was, they were going to drug test him and then I would come out dirty and then I would have to deal with DCF. So it wasn't, it was out of necessity and fear for my own selfish reasons, but it wasn't for the benefit of him or what was going to be in the best interest of my child that I'm carrying. It was because I was scared that I was going to suffer consequences for my own actions.",

7182989366749302059,Smoking has been shown to negatively impact fertility. It affects both men and women’s fertility and it’s been advised that those trying to get pregnant should quit smoking while trying to concieve and after getting pregnant. #smokingwhenpregnant #fertilityfact #fertilityexpert #fertilityfacts ," Today I want to talk about smoking and how it affects fertility. Smoking has significant negative effects on fertility for both men and women. Studies have shown that women who smoke are more likely to be infertile than women who don't smoke. Also, women who smoke undergo earlier menopause on the range of one to four years than women who don't. And finally, smoking has been shown to lead to increased rates of miscarriage. Smoking also affects male fertility. It's been shown to lead to lower sperm counts and lower sperm quality in men. It also can lead to DNA damage within the sperm. Studies have also shown that current smokers have lower success rates within fertility treatments like IVF than people who aren't smoking. It's recommended that both partners quit smoking when they're trying to get pregnant, but this can be really hard to do. However, there are steps that you can take if you're thinking about quitting smoking. You can use nicotine replacement therapy, like a patch, a lazenge, or gum to help cut back on cravings. There's also prescription medications that you can take to improve your chances of quitting. Using nicotine replacement therapy together with a prescription medication has been shown to be more successful in getting patients to stop smoking than using either of those alone. So if you're trying to quit smoking, it's good to talk to your health care provider about what your options are. One thing to note is that there is some data that nicotine replacement and these medications for quitting smoking could potentially negatively affect a fetus once a woman is pregnant. That's why it's especially recommended for women to try to quit smoking before becoming pregnant to minimize these risks.","Fashion accessory, Human face, Woman, Clothing, Glasses, Person MD,M, Seoo-aragement, Gullana Zaccardal.

7330175472732589355,#reddit #redditstories #redditreadings #askreddit #story #tooltips ," My dad neglected me for his narcissistic wife who wants to get rid of me. Now that they have a son they want me to move out. My dad and my mom separated a long time ago because my mom messed around a lot with substances. Her pregnancy was very high risk because she found it really hard to quit smoking and drinking. My dad made her quick cold turkey, but he would always find her with a drink in hand. I didn't suffer a lot for it, but it definitely messed me up. When my mom gave birth, my dad went through with a divorce and got full custody of me. Since it was just us for a long time, I got very used to his presence and being the only girl in his life. He was a very busy man but he always made time to watch movies with me, take me on vacation out of state, we even went to Disney World once. It was amazing with it just being the two of us. But then Nina came into the picture. Nina was my dad's wife whom he married five years ago. I'll admit I didn't like her. She stole my dad away all the time. She would constantly want to go on dates with him so I had to stay with a babysitter or by myself when I got older. It got really lonely and I missed spending time with my dad. It seemed like Nina had it out for me and wanted him to start a new life with him and without me. She never even tried to bond with me. My dad would push for us to do girly things together, but Nina would always say she's too tired or say she already had plans. I got the hint and stopped involving myself with her. Because of this distance between us, my dad started to forget I existed. He would make dinner for the two of us and he got into the habit of only making portions for two. This meant that whenever he cooked, I would have to eat some leftovers or heat up some frozen food because Nina would always eat all of it. I've tried to talk to my dad about it, but he says I'm young and still trying to adjust to this life. I told him it's been five years already, I should be used to it by now, but things only. Get worse because Nina hates me. He tried to tell me that Nina was also struggling to adjust to having a daughter so I should cut her some slack. Since then, I stopped confiding in my dad because he never took my problems seriously. I also had no other support to fall back on because we moved away from my grandparents when my dad married Nina. His family also didn't get along with Nina because I used to tell them how she treated me when we still lived close to them. This caused a lot of problems and we had to move away, which I'm still sad about to this day. I didn't know this for a while, but my dad and Nina were trying to have a child but couldn't. They kept this a secret from me so right off of that they weren't onto a good start. Then, they used a sperm donor because my dad found out he couldn't have any more kids. With that came along my half-brother Mark. Sharing my dad with Nina was already a lost cause and now I had to share him with a sibling too. It really felt like Nina was trying to keep me out of this family since she was really pushing on the two of them having kids. I mean my dad felt like a miracle since Mark was born. We used to spend two days a week together without Nina, but he told me he couldn't do that anymore with a new baby in the house. He explained that he couldn't leave his wife alone for two days a week with a newborn. I was obviously very angry about it because Nina had taken so much away from me. I kept distancing myself from them and they didn't even bother to check up on me. I wasn't seeking attention, but they hadn't heard from me or seen me in nearly a week and my dad never asked about it. Well, three days ago, he finally talked to me but it wasn't for the reason I wanted. I thought he was going to tell me he wanted to hang out with me like we used to or just have a nice conversation with me, but no. Him and Nina had decided to make a nursery for Mark instead of having him in their bedroom. I asked what was the problem with that and he said they just wanted their privacy. So our home has two master bedrooms and two bedrooms on the other side of the house. Those two bedrooms are empty so it was perfect for Mark, except Nina thought it was also difficult to go to the other side of the house multiple times at night when Mark woke up. I said that's why they should have him in their room, but my dad suggested something so much better. He wanted me to give up my master bedroom for this little baby. It wasn't up for negotiation either, he wanted me to pack my stuff up and move out of my room. I didn't even try to fight it because I had enough. I just said okay and started packing. I overheard him telling Nina that I had agreed and she got so happy. She started talking about how she would redecorate my room, rid the walls of the ugly paint color I had chosen, and just leave no trace of me ever being in that bedroom. I was pissed and called my uncle to come pick me up. When he came, I saw him talking to my dad and I just said, you can give my room to your son now, and we left. He texted me that I could only stay for one night, but I told my uncle I needed as much time apart from them as possible. I explained the whole situation to him, how Nina hates me, my dad won't listen to me anymore, and this new kid is replacing me. He let me stay for nearly a week. In that time, I saw my grandparents and I also told them everything. They were not happy at all and called my dad to tell him how bad of a father he is, along with some other names.

I am a smoker and I have been a smoker since I was like 15, 16 years old. I did quit cold turkey when I was pregnant with my daughter, but I started to stack up like right after she was born, which is so stupid, but a lot of life stressors play the fact into that. I have quit cold turkey again almost three days ago. I'm on the patch and like it helps a little bit with the cravings, but I feel like I'm having an anxiety attack 24-7. My body is shaking, my chest hurts, and my back hurts. So if you quit cold turkey and you are successful, can you please like give me some advice because I have to make this work because I cannot be a smoker and be pregnant. Like I just can't. I'm doing all of this stuff with a doctor to have a baby and being a smoker just like to feed the purpose. So any advice is welcome.",

7324449917307473198,"Two myths and a truth  Starting your periods at a younger age means earlier menopause Smoking can make you lose eggs faster and go into menopause earlier  Once your ovaries are removed, you can no longer get pregnant and deliver a baby The truth: ✅Smoking makes you go into menopause earlier. This is true!  Studies show that women who smoke go into menopause on average 2 years earlier than women who do not smoke. While most of this data is from cigarettes, we know that the nicotine in vaping products are also toxic to cells and so I recommend avoiding all nicotine.  The myths:  ⭐️Starting your periods at a younger age means earlier menopause. This is a myth!  Having a period earlier does NOT mean you will have an earlier menopause or lose eggs faster, so there’s one less thing to worry about.  ⭐️Once your ovaries are removed, you can no longer get pregnant and deliver a baby. This is false!  The ovaries produce the progesterone needed for early pregnancy, but between 7 and 10 weeks of pregnancy the placenta takes over. The placenta is the organ develops in the uterus alongside the fetus during pregnancy which connects the fetus to the mother for oxygen and nutrition. In a IVF cycle in a patient who has had their ovaries removed or who’s ovaries are no longer working, supplemental estrogen and progesterone are given until about 9 - 10 weeks of pregnancy and stopped because at that time, the placenta has taken over completely.

7142629848551263530,Do y’all have a list? #facts #pregnancy #pregnancytok #relatable #pregnancytiktok #pregnancyjourney #momtok #pregnant #greenscreen," Things I will not allow when my baby is born. Number one, kiss my baby. Whether y'all believe it or not, they're still covered around. They're still sickness wandering around. And people get cold sores and not tell anybody about it and just kiss random babies. So for my child safety, that will not happen. Even if you're a family member. Cause it's my baby what I say goes. Number two, Pitches from birth, to be posted before me. First of all, it's my kid. I want to be able to show the news and show that I deliver the baby. I don't want even family members doing that. It's just a pet peeve. Number three, anyone who didn't support be there as calming the baby we're doing or help me out and pregnancy will not be around my baby. I am not the time to hold a grudge. But when it comes to my mental health and my baby, I'm gonna say something. Cause if you're a family member or were a close friend of mine, you would simply ask how I'm doing. Or ask how the baby's doing. Or ask if I need anything. Or ask if I wanted to talk to somebody. Cause I've been spreading awareness about pregnancy depression and it's very real. So just someone who is apparently close to me or who is family to not ask or be there, it's just, yeah. Number four, hold my baby in the shirt. You smoke to cigarette in. See a lot of parents do this. I simply don't want my baby to smell that or be around that. Number five is basically the same thing as number four will not vape or smoke around my baby. I just don't want my kids smelling that stuff and I don't want my kid being around that. Number six, do not show up. I announced on my doorstep after coming home from the hospital. You have to ask one of the two parents of the baby. See this has been a pet peeve from the start. Like I don't like when someone shows up by my door and doesn't ask me or text me first if they can come over. Like if I just come from the hospital and you show up, that's just interrupting my focus on the baby. Which is the time to learn how to take care of my baby. If I need help, I will simply ask. Number seven is mess up my feeding schedule. If you are gonna babysit my baby, I'm gonna have a schedule just like any other pair. And if I see that you mess up the schedule or mess up the sleep in schedule, I'm gonna give Matt. Cause this is my baby. Like you don't need to mess up my child schedule. See, I don't know if I'm ever gonna let people babysit my baby this. I don't know, I don't know.",
7314663228154449183,#fyp #foryou #reddit #redditstories #relationship #reddit_tiktok #redditstorytime #redditguy #redditstoriestts #redditespañol ," My dad neglected me for his narcissistic wife who wants to get rid of me. Now that they have a son they want me to move out. My dad and my mom separated a long time ago because my mom messed around a lot with substances. Her pregnancy was very high risk because she found it really hard to quit smoking and drinking. My dad made her quick cold turkey, but he would always find her with a drink in hand. I didn't suffer a lot for it, but it definitely messed me up. When my mom gave birth, my dad went through with a divorce and got full custody of me. Since it was just us for a long time, I got very used to his presence and being the only girl in his life. He was a very busy man but he always made time to watch movies with me, take me on vacation out of state, we even went to Disney World once. It was amazing with it just being the two of us. But then Nina came into the picture. Nina was my dad's wife whom he married five years ago. I'll admit I didn't like her. She stole my dad away all the time. She would constantly want to go on dates with him so I had to stay with a babysitter or by myself when I got older. It got really lonely and I missed spending time with my dad. It seemed like Nina had it out for me and wanted him to start a new life with him and without me. She never even tried to bond with me. My dad would push for us to do girly things together, but Nina would always say she's too tired or say she already had plans. I got the hint and stopped involving myself with her. Because of this distance between us, my dad started to forget I existed. He would make dinner for the two of us and he got into the habit of only making portions for two. This meant that whenever he cooked, I would have to eat some leftovers or heat up some frozen food because Nina would always eat all of it. I've tried to talk to my dad about it, but he says I'm young and still trying to adjust to this life. I told him it's been five years already, I should be used to it by now, but things only. Get worse because Nina hates me. He tried to tell me that Nina was also struggling to adjust to having a daughter so I should cut her some slack. Since then, I stopped confiding in my dad because he never took my problems seriously. I also had no other support to fall back on because we moved away from my grandparents when my dad married Nina. His family also didn't get along with Nina because I used to tell them how she treated me when we still lived close to them. This caused a lot of problems and we had to move away, which I'm still sad about to this day. I didn't know this for a while, but my dad and Nina were trying to have a child but couldn't. They kept this a secret from me so right off of that they weren't onto a good start. Then, they used a sperm donor because my dad found out he couldn't have any more kids. With that came along my half brother Mark. Sharing my dad with Nina was already a lost cause and now I had to share him with a sibling too. It really felt like Nina was trying to keep me out of this family since she was really pushing on the two of them having kids. Seeing my dad felt like a miracle since Mark was born. We used to spend two days a week together without Nina, but he told me he couldn't do that anymore with a new baby in the house. He explained that he couldn't leave his wife alone for two days a week with a newborn. I was obviously very angry about it because Nina had taken so much away from me. I kept distancing myself from them and they didn't even bother to check up on me. I wasn't seeking attention, but they hadn't heard from me or seen me in nearly a week and my dad never asked about it. Well, three days ago, he finally talked to me but it wasn't for the reason I wanted. I thought he was going to tell me he wanted to hang out with me like we used to or just have a nice conversation with me, but no. Him and Nina had decided to make a nursery for Mark instead of having him in their bedroom. I asked what was the problem with that and he said they just wanted their privacy. So, our home has two master bedrooms and two bedrooms on the other side of the house. Those two bedrooms are empty so it was perfect for Mark, except Nina thought it was also difficult to go to the other side of the house multiple times at night when Mark woke up. I said that's why they should have him in their room, but my dad suggested something so much better. He wanted me to give up my master bedroom for this little baby. It wasn't up for negotiation either, he wanted me to pack my stuff up and move out of my room. I didn't even try to fight it because I had enough. I just said okay and started packing. I overheard him telling Nina that I had agreed and she got so happy. She started talking about how she would redecorate my room, rid the walls of the ugly pink color I had chosen, and just leave no trace of me ever being in that bedroom. I was pissed and called my uncle to come pick me up. When he came, I saw him talking to my dad and I just said, you can give my room to your son now, and we left. He texted me that I could only stay for one night, but I told my uncle I needed as much time apart from them as possible. I explained the whole situation to him, how Nina hates me, my dad won't listen to me anymore, and this new kid is replacing me. He let me stay for nearly a week. In that time, I saw my grandparents and I also told them everything. They were not happy at all and called my dad to tell him how bad of a father he is, along with some other names. I heard my dad say he didn't trust their judgment because I'm obviously the favorite so of course they're going to take my side. I was sad that was his whole take away on this whole thing. It wasn't just about taking my side. It's about how I've been neglected ever since Nina entered into our lives and he refuses to see that.","Book, Parking Meter, Human hand, Food, Houseplant, Person, Poster, Flower, Microphone, Watch, Human leg, Pen, Fashion accessory, Toy, Box, Computer Mouse, Ball, Camera, Mobile Phone, Perfume, Flowerpot, Human foot, Door, Wheel, Footwear OTiTok, our, 19, @user456330391082, on, stay, 20, 38mm, pick, your, who, say, 111, CTikTOk, C TiKTOk, we, fuue as e, 7, @user563303910812, us., @user4563308910812, Tool, er4563303910812, @user4563303910812-, Tool_Tips, @user4563303910812., d Tok, 44mm, .er than the wood elf.

Number one, please take a prenatal vitamin containing folic acid. Folic acid has been shown to prevent neural tube defects in your baby. So please, please, please do that. That's super, super important. Smoking is a big no, no. That is beyond any doubt has been shown to have an effect on fertility, on miscarriages. Smoking is something that I absolutely would ask you to quit or not recommend in the least bit. In terms of caffeine, the data gets a little bit hazy with caffeine. Light to moderate caffeine use is probably okay and I'm going to qualify this when I say light to moderate. I mean less than two cups of coffee a day. So you know, and this is assuming that you get your caffeine only from caffeine, not from tea, not from chocolates, not from other sources. So essentially light to moderate caffeine use is probably okay and as far as alcohol goes, same. You obviously don't want to consume any alcohol when you're pregnant, but leading up to pregnancy, any sort of very light drinking is probably okay less than two drinks a day. And you know, honestly, if you want to be extra prepared and you know, stop drinking alcohol completely, that's fine too.",

7049467392212143366,like and follow for part 2 🥰 #fyp," Meet 23-year-old admin assistant Amy Cook. It's cute though, isn't it? Oh, my God. It's my damn brooder. In five months' time, she's going to be a mum. I think I'm... I just can't wait. It's an exciting time with baby gloves to buy. I really like that one, so I think I'm so cute. And dad to be Andy, fiting over her at home. Oh, yeah. But not everything's perfect. For the past four months, Amy's unborn baby has been puffing on 15 cigarettes a day. When I have a scan and seeing the baby move in, I'm really going to jet here, cut for it. Well, it's not doing no damage to the baby and just carried on as normal, really. Just like every day. Sigger it. I've got a cigarette. There's just no stopping this dedicated chain smoker. Why? I love my mind in cigarette. I can't imagine what I'm thinking about a cigarette. I won't go to work. And Amy can't see herself quitting anytime soon. Why? What I feel like at the minute is that you just put me in a straight jacket and locked me away. I go mad. It's time for work, but their smoke-free office car contain Amy and smoking-buddy Darren for long. You need to go show them that some more sense. And with a baby on the way, her constant smoking breaks have shocked her colleagues. But you get fun with what we are. I've been a few comments of people, I don't know how I want to do this, not smoking. But still, I think I've got to deal with you. Why? By lunchtime, Amy's well on her way to smoking her usual 15 fags. And that means, baby, too. Everyone in Amy's life smokes, including her mum Jenny and her 20-day boyfriend Andy. Stop stressing. Because the stress will do more damage and cigarette. I keep thinking that thousands and millions of people don't do smoke when they're pregnant. I smoke when I'm having all of you. And it's none of you have ever been poorly or anything. So don't stress. There's one family member who is concerned. Non-smoking sister-in-law Claire, who's also pregnant. How many are just smoking a day? About 10. So why not? 10 to 15. That's shocking, Amy. I know. No, that is really shocking. So I will give up as soon as possible. I really do. You had given up 15 weeks ago by now if you was that determined. I've tried a couple of times, but it just doesn't work. It does work. It's called willpower. And you've got willpower. And you've got willpower. And you've got your baby and doing your best you can for it. I haven't got any willpower. I really haven't. With her baby arriving soon, Amy definitely needs to wake up to the risk of smoking while pregnant. Tomorrow she meets her specialist smoking cessation midwife.","Handbag, Picture frame, Table, Man, Person, Car, Poster, Flower, Lamp, Bottle, Bus, Clothing, Building, Vase, Wine Glass, Fashion accessory, Backpack, Bed, Human face, Woman, Shelf, Nightstand, Laptop, Desk, Necklace, Girl, Chair, Glasses, Footwear, Tree Solving all minor and major extemal cleaning problems, NYIO, I, MAYFAIR, 4 MONTHS PREGNANT, INCN, - ., part 1, J, 7.03 AM, KING SIZE, FAIR, O, CIGARETTE 2, CIGARETTE, SOKES 15 A DAY, Cams, 12.29 PM, woman puffing her way, Solving al minor and major extemal cleaning problems, SMOKES 15 A DAY, clean, 12.05 PM, 10.59 AM, MOERGG, Smoking, P, CRFFE, MD, AMY, -, $, CIGARETTE 5, S, BAN, d TikTok, TikTok, CIGARETTE I, Kille, kills, early days, 10.03 AM, through pregnancy, NERO, KING LIZE, CIGARETTE 6, AVE, 7.45 AM, @omgstories_66, T, ean, CIGARETTE 7, Buildings2, CIGARETTE 4"

Vaping is also far more successful. #foryoupage," What's up, Bay Fam? A new clinical trial study found that vaping was as safe as nicotine patches for pregnant women trying to quit smoking during pregnancy. Which is pretty damn interesting honestly because it really kind of says that hey vaping is as safe as some of the most popular nicotine replacement therapies out there even if you're pregnant. A lot of tobacco control are kind of spinning it a little bit differently just saying hey there's no difference between nicotine patches and e-cigarettes for pregnant women as far as safety. Even though nicotine patches have been claimed to be safe for pregnant women to use for quite a while so really the study saying that e-cigarettes are as safe as nicotine replacement therapy even for pregnant women trying to quit smoking.

7309910884917316910,#redditstories #redditwoman #us#viral #fyp ," X smokers, how did you overcome your addiction to cigarettes? So it all started with my mother. She smoked most of her life. She definitely didn't let up when she was pregnant with me. I was born under weight, as is typical. I was breastfed, and then she tried to wean me. I started having startling symptoms. Shaking, screaming. She thought I was having a seizure. Dr. Set I was going through nicotine withdrawal as a baby. I was jonesing for my nicotine fixed to the point I'd bully my younger brother off the honker. I got at least a good two solid years of breastfeeding, monopolizing it to the point where my mom got so sick of breastfeeding that she took my brother off early. Smoking was in the house constantly. I always wanted to sit by mommy when she smoked. The fumes were a part of my life. I started officially smoking at 12. All my friends coughing? Evan casuals, I ripped the filters off because that's how mommy do. I moved on from those Virginia slums to Marborough with the filters ripped off. By the time I was 16 I decided to come out with my habit to my mother because I figured only an idiot couldn't tell I was a smoker. I mean, she could even smell it because of the brand change. Well, she cried, yelled and I was just staring at her dump-founded. She tried her best to make me feel like a worthless, weak piece of crap for picking up this habit that she tried so hard to shield me from and that she raised me better. Then she lights a cigarette up and says look how much you've stressed me out. This is coming from the woman that when I begged her to quit when I was younger she screamed in my face that this was one thing in her life that she could enjoy. So, she verbally and emotionally abuses me from this point out. Her room smells disgusting because you smoke. I'm going to start smoking outside because I don't want this house to smell like crap. Yeah that lasted a week. Anyways I turned 18 soon after. I officially and legally can smoke. Mom. Start sending me off to pick up the smokes. When life gives lemons you make lemonade I guess. She also never, never let me off the hook. Always had something to say about me smoking and how she wasn't as bad. I smoked those menthol ones for a bit. Started coughing up lead. Decided to stop those. I stopped eating much. I then lived off of cigarettes and Dr. Pepper. Leading to me dropping to 94 pounds. So then I turned 19. I met a guy who doesn't smoke. I decided that year I'm going to quit. My mom, desperate to somehow keep on some level with me, so she's going to do it too. Well my boyfriend helped me quit, I used the patches for about two weeks. Then I just got effing tired of using them so I stopped them and went cold turkey. My mom fell off the wagon and tried to hide it from me but with me getting my sense of smell back, as well as her coughing up chunks of tar, I could smell it all over her. She then started trying to control my life more. She now doesn't want to let me go anywhere and says I have to stay home and watch my brother. I ran away from home when I was 20 and didn't talk to her a few years because she insisted on keeping the relationship toxic. I now haven't smoked in nearly 10 years. But I still dream of cigarettes. It's still a struggle. I think about going back to it all the time.","Poster, Toy, Stairs, Christmas Tree, Swimming Pool, Tree, House, Building, Box, Plant, Picture frame, Window @story.Ifal, 3-17 Reply, By the time I was 16 I decided, younger brother offne, Flint and Steel, yelled and I was just staring, this habit that she tried so, me off to pick up the stokes, sto, DOHNLORD, who doesn't smoke., I mean I could just climb above it, she verbally and, nick, withdrawal as a baty, as is, But Istill dream of cigarettes., @story.1fa1, Epping casuals: I ripped, Doctor saidilwas, piece, Doctor said I was, +3frmor Toughness, Virginia Slims to Marlboro, my sense of sme TkTok, now doesn't want to let, 2, Ustor, Tik Tok, with the filters ripped off, as wellas her coughing, it because of the, Ex smokers, I turned 19.

But why? Oh, okay, yeah. Tough one, right? There's so many things that we get told about in pregnancy. And you're like, yeah, but is there like little bad and big bad and which bad? And there's so many things you have to stop doing and modify your doing and can you just have a little bit more clarity on just how bad is bad? Right? Yeah, I get it. I understand. So yeah, welcome along. I'm Kathy Frey and I'm from Kathy Frey.com and I'm a semi-retired senior midwife and I'll be selling meds. A maternity author. So welcome along and if you want to check out more about information and resources available, you can go to Kathy Frey.com but also to the Motherways app. So just dub, dub, motherways.apb and that's our online premium prenatal education program. Which is awesome. But anyway, I digress. So smoking. All right. So yeah, look, there are just so many things that we're told to give up. And it's just nice to have a little bit more clarity on exactly how bad is bad. Okay. So there's two, basically there's two aspects of smoking. And it's really interesting to understand the science behind it all. Okay. So number one is nicotine. That if you are not prepared to go through nicotine with draw to yourself during the pregnancy, then that means that you are forcing your baby to go through nicotine with draw after it's born. Oh, that's a bit of a tough thing to put on a brand new person. Yeah. So your baby will go through several days or several weeks of normal nicotine with draw. So that's feeling sad, feeling irritable, feeling tired. What if headaches, you know, like it's not pleasant. So yeah, I can't recommend it enough that you go through it. Don't put your baby through it. Okay. That's the first thing. Second thing is super fascinating scientifically, I think. Okay. So what happens is that every hemoglobin molecule in our body has got four iron atoms on it. And those four iron atoms are what oxygen molecules attach to when we inhale. Right. So in hairline and four oxygen molecules are attaching to each iron atom in our hemoglobin molecules. And I made it a little bit for you. So here we go. You've got these four iron molecules, iron atoms, I should say, on each hemoglobin molecule. Now there's about 280 million hemoglobin molecules that make up each red blood cell, which means each red blood cell needs more than a billion iron atoms. And each red blood cell will have bonded to it when you inhale more than a billion oxygen molecules, like it's mind blowing, right. And that, by the way, explains why, you know, when you are pregnant, you know, by the time you get to the third trimester, you've got like up to almost one and a half times the blood circulating in your body of a non-pregnant you. And this is why so many women get iron depletion anemia in pregnancy, like so many, because they just had no, it's hard to appreciate just how huge, what huge amount of iron that you need in pregnancy. Okay, but yeah, I mean, you need over a billion iron atoms for every single red blood cell. So when you get an iron depletion anemia in pregnancy, you know, that's when you get tired and you feel weak and you get pale skin and you get shortness of breath, because there's not enough red blood cells to attach all those iron oxygen molecules to. You get dizzy, like, head illness, cold hands, cold feet, etc, etc. Anyway, okay, so go back to smoking. Carbon, why not carbon monoxide from cigarettes has a 200 to 300 times stronger bond to those iron atoms on the hemoglobin molecules that oxygen. So oxygen has to compete and it loses, it loses to carbon monoxide of cigarette. So that carbon monoxide, while you're smoking, like you basically, you're practically inhaling, bugger all oxygen, because you're inhaling carbon monoxide and that attaches. So you go from aerobic, meaning with oxygen metabolism to anaerobic, so that's without oxygen metabolism. And the effects continue for about 20 minutes or so after you're finished to cigarette. So if you say a cigarette takes 10 minutes and there's a 20 minute after effect, this is basically for 30 minutes or half an hour for every cigarette, your body is in oxygen deporation. And when you're pregnant, so is your baby. And the problem is, let's say, I don't know, if your body, if your baby dealt with that one time in 24 hours, it's okay, it probably wouldn't have a huge effect. But if you're smoking, say, you know, 10 cigarettes a day, that's five hours a day, your baby's in anaerobic, meaning without oxygen metabolism, five hours a day, that's a lot, right? And because it doesn't have oxygen to be able to do glycolysis or cellular respiration metabolism, it means it has to use its structure to do that rather than the oxygen. So it breaks down its own body to do it. So this is why these babies are born really skinny and weedy because they've had to break down their own body to continue their cellular metabolism in this oxygen deprived situation. And yet, not ideal, right? So you've got this really weedy, skinny baby. And I have to say, if we can visibly see what it does to a baby, which we do, what the heck is it done to its brain? Ooh, right? What does it do to a developing brain if you're having 10 cigarettes a day, so five hours a day, your baby's in oxygen deprivation, wouldn't it? It's trying to grow a brain? Okay, so look, that's a lot of reason, right? To give up. And look, my hand on heart, I'm not going to pretend that I'm some angel. I gave up smoking three times two, three pregnancies. I'm not asking you to stop smoking forever and ever and ever. I want you to stop smoking for your pregnancy, just like I did. Okay, you can do it. So here's I do smoke cigarettes. I might have, you know, a few socially a week, but I'm not a daily smoker. Anyway, enough of that. But I'm just saying it, I guess to, you know, fiss up until I say, I'm not some angel. I'm just saying, let's do what it takes. And, you know, you can do what it takes. Just as like I did what it takes. And there's going to be so many freaking things that we sacrifice for our children, you know, over the years. And it's just going to be one of many. So that's cool. We do what it takes, right? We do what it takes to give the best to our kids. So hopefully that you found that really interesting that it was like getting the science behind it, right?

He will help you. I know not all of us are, but I actually cried to God a month before I got pregnant, begging him to find the strength to quit smoking. I don't think there's anything wrong with smoking weed. Actually, I really don't see the issue in it, but I was smoking heavily every day and it was very hard on my mental health. I literally could not go a day without being sober. And God gave me a baby. Not only did He give me a baby, He gave me a baby with the first man I ever got with. The first man to show me what real love was other than my dad. And after a condom, a year's worth of birth control, general anesthesia and a car wreck, I still came out with my baby. And he is healthy for all of you who are so concerned. And I'm six months sober and happy as can be. So, thank you.",

But shortly after giving birth, Bella realized that motherhood is no joke. And sometimes she takes her anger out on him, no I'm just kidding. But today she got a moment to herself and apparently she's really excited about it and she wanted everybody to know safety first, bitch. So she went to a drive-through liquor store and I'm gonna let everybody know right now she's not breastfeeding so cut her some slack. But she really needed a cigarette and I do not blame her for it. Because the girls who get it get it and the girls who don't shut the fuck up. But this is her first cigarette in damn near a year. And she said it felt like the first time she ever smoked a cigarette. And what's crazy is she became less bitchy to me after she took a puff. Joking she's still a bitch. And this ain't her first time smoking so she already had the Fubri's on deck. And then she went to McDonald because her baby need chicken nuggets, non-kitting. Clearly we lost signal and I blamed her iPhone 11 for it. But anyways, while she was out she couldn't stop thinking about her baby the entire time. And it was a good moment for her to have to herself but she's ready to go back and be a mama. Anyway, she's held a funny so Yasha follow her.",

7308540004152741122,"A baby's birth weight is a key indicator of future health and development.  There are plenty of modifiable factors to assist in preventing low birth weight.  These factors include; Length of pregnancy - a large percentage of low birth babies are born prematurely so supporting a pregancy to reach full term reduces the risk of low birth weight.  Mother's diet during pregnancy - this is incredibly important to ensure the nutrient demands of pregnancy are met for both mum and baby. Nutrient deficiencies are linked to low birth weight.  Quitting smoking well before conception - smoking, especially during pregnancy, significantly increases the chances of low birth weight due to nicotine causing constriction of the blood vessels to the unbilical cord and placenta.  We recommend a minimum of 3 months preconception care to ensure there is an adequate amount of time prior to conception to address possible risk factors for low birth weight to achieve the best pregnancy and birth outcomes.

Walking around with a Wells because he has not been put down today. But I wanted to share a patient's success story with you guys with the patient's permission of course. So, a couple months ago I got a phone call from a prospective patient kind of asking us how our practice worked. We explained to her that we do not build insurance, our practice functions like a gym membership. It's $80 a month, that covers everything she needs from us, right? She said, all right, well, you know, I'm on a fixed income. I don't know that I can afford it. And I'll let you know if things change. All right, perfect, let us know. So, she called back about a week later and said, you know what? The reason why I need a PCP is I really want to stop smoking. I've tried to do it on my own. I have not been successful, but I did some math. And if I stop smoking, I can afford the membership. So in Georgia actually, I had no idea how much a pack of cigarettes costs. It's $5.35 is the average. So she was smoking a pack a day. So if you multiply, you're in just $5 times 30. That's $3. Math is hard, $150. So anyway, she came in, we talked, we came up with a plan. We did some well but train, which is about $4 a month, medicine for all pharmacy. And within a month, she had stopped smoking. She was saving $150 a month, paying us $80. And then $4 a month for her well but train, which we eventually got her off of. And then while during one of her visits, she told us that she was really having trouble losing weight, feeling tired all the time. She was like, well, you know, I have lots of reasons to be tired, right? Like don't we all? But did some basic lab work on her found out that she has high both iridesm. So we are treating her high both iridesm now. So anyway, she came in because she wanted to stop smoking. It ended up helping her with that and then some. And this is why I really love my job.

You could do it then. I cannot can sterilize a woman without her knowledge. I need her consent. It's the only way to keep her from coming back pregnant in the year. Okay, okay, okay. Emily is a disaster. No one wants to see her coming back pregnant, but Addison is right. She has to sign off on sterilization. Just because Emily has made bad decisions doesn't mean that we take away her right to have children. Why are we only discussing her rights? What about David's rights? His David. Her first born. Eight weeks premature. He went blind from being on a ventilator. He's been in seven homes and six years. Turns out he's not only blind. He's autistic. Brad was second. He's severely disabled due to fetal alcohol syndrome. He's in a home for especially his kids. Then there was a April who's, well, she's still in foster care. Because he wants a crack baby. And then there was Daniel who survived for 16, excruciating days in NICU before he's become short-balsamil. I signed his death certificate myself. You think she wants this baby? She's a mucous baby.

Goodbye cigarettes, goodbye loneliness, constant stress preoccupied pondering. When can I have that next breath of death? Goodbye regret, tar soaked clothes, goodbye lying, goodbye control. Even when I know I'm right, if you want to die that's not my fight I have to let you go. Like the cigarettes constant pull. Like that sugar that made me feel so full and empty at the same time. I'm okay with losing my mind if that's what it takes. Adrenaline is not my friend pushing me to follow her every whim. A quick release Thanksgiving feast with a coma at the end. Goodbye addiction.",

And then also these concerns which are flying around about flavours. My beef is primarily with the media and of course irresponsible academics who put out these health scares and you have them all the time. And in the study I was telling you about the pregnancy study. When we did end of pregnancy follow-ups, there were quite a few women who said I stopped smoking with e-cigarettes and I read in the newspaper that it may kill me. That was the avali scare. And I went back to smoking because smoking may not be as dangerous as this and was exasperating. And you realised how these type of sound bites which people do actually have real consequences for even people that it's really irresponsible and unethical to go out and for instance when a study finds that nicotine increases heart rate, they issue, you know, a press release saying, vaping is as dangerous as smoking and risk damaging your heart. And so just, you know, if there was a way of stopping that barrage or affecting it more effectively with some kind of counter statements that would certainly help.","Tie, Bottle, Human face, Woman, Clothing, Hat, Man, Glasses, Person , @rightvapevi, cto Penalty-., . . ., next, a Order., Royal College of Physicians - London9 December, Uplc, 12 Penalty.., Science, sta Penalty..., More from E-Cigare, tchv, Royal College of Physicians - London-9 December, Penaity, les, Royal Collego of Physicians Landor 9 D 2022, atch v, 5504 Ga., 2, be, etv, Autoplay next, cta Penalty.., latch v, Tik Tok, G ten leg., . .

I think it's because you get a combination of that 2D-4D flavor The hands of mouth and the oral fixation I present to you candy sour spray I was actually inspired to try this from others here on TikTok a lot of people use the warhead sour spray I like this one. It's sugar free. This flavor is strawberry. So if you see me walking around like a mother fucking fourth grader just And I've got a neon colored tongue baby manja biz",
7323251854014647598,"This time last year I set goals and I did them. I cut out soda. I even quit smoking cigarettes. I started eating better and just not as much as i use too. I went to the gym everyday I worked hard to get to where I am now I’m damn proud of myself. I went from 215 to 165. 😊 although I am proud of myself I still have a long way to go to be comfortable and happy with myself. Trying to lose  that baby belly pouch has been a bitch. 🤣  Im back at it and I’m gonna keep working hard at it everyday to get to where I want though. 😊 And I have been stuck at 165 cause I fell off the gym wagon for a few months.  I was going through some shit mentally like feeling lonely, abandoned and shit ton more. Realizing you lost the only friends and family you had left In texas is really just a kick in the the gut. That’s my own fault I fell off and started distancing myself for good reasons. You can say I ghost people. But I say I’m growing through what I went through. I’m healing my own wounds cause believe me I went through a lot of shit in the past year and just in general growing up.  Im writing this to say it’s okay to fall off if you get the fuck back up!! Because you can do it, set goals, make family outing plans, go to the gym. Do what you need to do for YOU AND YOU ONLY. Don’t ever let anyone tell you can’t do something.  Lucky for me I have a wonderful hubby who has been by my side who has let me talk my feelings out to him and cry to him. But he has also been my biggest supporter and pushed me to keep going cause we have fought are demons and battles together and were gonna keep winning. TOGETHER. 🖤 If you’re a mom I know you are a full time mom, full time worker, provider, doctor, maid and cook. 🖤 But make sure to make the time for yourself whether it be the spa, shopping, glass of wine with a book, gym or a walk.

7286863816116292895,This channel is all about quitting smoking and quitting vaping. #quitvaping #quitsmoking #addictionmindset  ," Should I quit nicotine high school edition? Alright, let's look at the pros of quitting nicotine. So the first thing is you're going to be saving money. And what is it that you're saving money on? Being able to do whatever I want to do and spend it on what I want to spend it on. Absolutely. Spending money on the things that you actually want to be doing. Better relationships. This would include the relationships among the people that care, that you vape, that don't want to be around you because you're baby and you're smoking or whatever. Less health anxiety. Less worry about potential future health problems. Have you ever been hitting a burnt vape and wondering what's this doing to my lungs? What's going to happen a few years from now? When you quit, you don't have to worry about that anymore. Improved self-respect. Set in self-esteem. When you say you're going to do something and you do that something through that helps to build confidence. And having more confidence is always a good thing. What about the image that you have among your peers and your friends? It's like how they see you. How they see you as a person so it's an influence that you have over them, right? So when I influence other people, I don't want to be a negative influence on someone encouraging them to use a substance. I want to be something positive to other people. Completely agree. Less depression. A rebalancing of dopamine. And dopamine is what's responsible for our motivation and our drive to want to do tasks. Improved focus because we're not thinking about hitting the vape all day long. Trustworthiness not only among others but among who the most. Among ourselves, right? Yeah. I can say that I'm going to do something and I see that something through. Improved self-discipline. At any time, we practice something that requires discipline. We improve that. And then what are the ground ones? No more ground ones. What are we talking about there? The nicotine receptors in your mind that you're no longer feeding. So they're just like, I want my nicotine. They start to die off, right? And then you're not dealing with that all day long with your sitting class. Disciplinary actions in school or at home or at work. So this would be like getting suspended from vagine or getting grounded, getting your phone taken away. You don't have to worry about that anymore. And then no more anandodonia. This plays a role with the dopamine rebalancing. At any time, we're addicted to a drug. Nicotine being a drug. It decreases dopamine levels. Dopamine is part of what brings us joy in life. And when we have a drug addiction, we wind up developing anandodonia. Because we lose the joy in day-to-day things that should make us happy if we're missing the drug. So this goes away once you start to quit. Now though, there are some cons to quitting nicotine. The first count of five of the most popular ones is the hive. What's the hive? What is that? It's like the buzz that you feel when you hit a vape for the first time in a while. And that's not going to be there anymore after you quit. But the reality is, if we were to quote the passengers, only know you've been high when you're feeling low. Right? Is that not right? You're only high for a temporary period of time. But it doesn't stay that way. And that's the problem. That's the cycle with addiction. You're going to get bad withdrawal symptoms and intense cravings when you quit. And that's a kind. But the reality is, aren't you already going to withdrawal every single day that you make? Yeah, because there are points in time when you're not vaping. And it goes through your system fast. That's absolutely right. So your withdrawal is something you're already dealing with. Same with cravings. There's symptom of withdrawal. But they do get a little more intense initially when you quit. Pure pressure. So this is being around your friends. And pure pressure is not so much I think that people are pressuring you to vape. But it's more of this phone number. What's phone number? Pure of missing out. Okay, so this is like thinning in with a certain group of people or something like that. Okay. But and this is probably the hardest kind of quitting. You gotta start to ask yourself, is this a group of people that I want to be fitting in with at the end of the day? Not saying that people who vape are bad people or smoke or drink that's not what I'm saying. But the people you hang out with are ultimately getting determined your behaviors in life and what's acceptable and unacceptable. So this is the top pole to swallow, but it's one that's worth looking at. There's the pros and cons of quitting. I don't know, but it looks like there seems to be a bit more on the pros side than the cons side. Is that what Greg? Yeah. Yeah, I would agree. Alright, maybe we'll work on quitting then.","Fashion accessory, Whiteboard, Watch, Desk, Chair, Clothing, Table, Man, Footwear, Person , .euve be, -Improverfous, on, Jopamine rebalence, otations acoond, disciplinary actions in, Lcoling, a respent, - ath anxiety, +h Passa, -cad wimdrawl symptoms, trustwonthine, dthe, -Improvedfacs, cnc:Stronge, Tad geis worse woren, -Por pressure, -dopamine reboalence, worse wne, Ony Erow, ocin, fons aroond, ximage among feers, onl, Knigh/oa, quit nicotine ?hason, Pissare, - neath anxiety, (1s that inca ou, Con, ons acoond, nh, hign bea it don', ximage amon Peers, guIt nicotine ?

7311135722487041326,GET RID OF THE SMOKE SMELL IN YOUR CLOTHES! #quitsmoking🍃 #quitsmoking🚭 #addictionrecovery #breakingaddiction #quitsmokingcoldturkey #fyp ," One of the toughest part of quitting Zah is removing that Zah smoke off your clothes. That burnt clip smell off your clothes. And this video I'm going to share some products that help me and it will definitely help you. So for starters, I recommend do not use any powder detergent. That doesn't really work out for me. It doesn't really, it's not really good for your clothes, but I recommend getting this right here. Get you some typods. There's going to remove that stank smell. That burnt clip smell off on your clothes and it keeps it real clean. It works phenomenal. Trust me. I'm going to use typods now. You better get to them. This detergent right here is really for babies, but I like that because I had some sensitive skin. Before I got into the typods, I used to use powder detergent. I really wasn't working for me or making it into little bit. So I used to use this and this also helped me remove all that burnt clip or that wee smoke off my clothes. That's right here. Nuders and boos. This is like the cheek hole right here. You need to get yourself some booster beads. This is going to move any bad smell. Not only the Zah smoke smell. You need burnt clip, any bad funky smell. You got any clothes. This is the cheek hole right here. My favorite is the down here as you can see. Once you've done washing your clothes and you ready for them to dry, you need to use dry shoes. This is another gel brake cheek hole that you need to get that smell off your clothes. For me, I use bounce. That's what I use and it works perfectly. Also this is an essential. You want to get it absorbed before your closet. This is going to remove any bad odor that you have in your closet and where your clothes are at. You want to put an absorbable up there. This is my favorite right here. The black charcoal one. It looks cool and it takes any bad smell. If you have any wee smoke from before, this is going to remove it for you. If you don't want to spend the back on the black charcoal ones, you can always get the arms to hammer one. It's a little cheaper and also works, but just not as good at the black charcoal ones. This is good also. I got these first and they helped me out too. Just absorbs any bad smell out the closet. Those are just some of the products I recommend and my Amazon store for you.

", It is insane to me how y'all are trying to justify vaping well pregnant. I even gave you all the leniency to say that maybe quitting cold turkey is not the best thing if that's what your doctor said. Because a lot of y'all said that in the comments. So I'm not going to discredit you on that. But you're telling me your doctor says that it's better for you to continue vaping your entire pregnancy than to try and ween off. People ween off all the time. I quit cold turkey and I know a lot of people who have. But to say that it's better to smoke the entire pregnancy instead of at least trying to ween off. Is ridiculous and selfish. I'm sorry. The first source that pops up on Google says we do not see any fetal distress or withdrawal issues from a abrupt nicotine secession. Like we do with illicit drugs such as heroin in regards to quitting cold turkey while pregnant. And one of the other first articles that pops up in regards to quitting cold turkey while pregnant says stopping smoking is one of the best things you can do for yourself and your baby. And the sooner you can quit the better. There's no evidence that stopping cold turkey is at all dangerous for you or your baby.

So because this exchange between Charlie and his mother Sean was kept from me, very shortly after, right before we celebrated our three months of hooking up, I ended up getting evicted from my roommates. Because apparently Sean co-hersed Charlie into telling my roommate that I confided in him and told him that I, in fact, did sleep with her boyfriend. That I didn't find out until after I gave birth. Obviously, being homeless and having nowhere to go, I confided in Charlie because we were close. And lucky me, I ended up pregnant. And Charlie acted like he was completely thrilled and asked his grandma if I could stay. So when the announcement was made, that I was pregnant and moving in with Charlie and his grandmother will call her Betty. Because of the fact that I didn't know these exchanges behind my back had been happening, imagine my surprise when I woke up the next morning after the announcement to total chaos downstairs. I woke up in bed next to Charlie thinking that his grandma was downstairs getting robbed and attacked first thing in the morning. Imagine how shook I was when I ran downstairs to check on Betty. Say here, Sean, ran to him, raving and cussing at her mother over me living there and having her son's baby. So when I entered the living room and asked her what her deal was, she tried to lunge at me like she was going to kill me. I was 19 years old pregnant with a raging eating disorder. I didn't even weigh 120 pounds. She wasn't overweight, mother of seven in her late 30s. I was terrified. Charlie rushed down and explained to me that maybe it was just the shock of the pregnancy. And to go back in our room and lock the door, him and his grandma would handle it. From the upstairs window which I was smoking out of at the time, I could hear her stomp out of the house and slam the front and storm door. And since she lived right across the street, I heard her cuss me out the entire way she crossed the street and went up the steps to her home. Things only got worse from there. Part four will be posted next.","Human mouth, Lipstick, Human face, Woman, Clothing, Girl little baby's health., I, soon as I got the official, J, another human being's, *Yes I was still smoking pot, I made the, long as I was pregnant and, pregnant through, o TikTok, problems., IT, very beginning, documentation I was, @baddiemartina, thet, ikTok, P, d TikTOk, a, at the very, choice away or alter my, *Also KY would notify CPS, S, d TikTok, o TiKTok, TikTok, and nobody wants those, dTikTok, c TikTok, breast feeding because I, conscious decision to quit, smoking mar!ju@n@ for as, Healthpoint, breast feeding because, Part 3, of my pregnancy.

7329277569549831466,#fyp pregnant and addicted. ," While I was pregnant with my son, I was addicted to methamphetamine. And I ended up giving birth to my son under the influence of methamphetamine. It's still to this day the hardest thing for me to talk about. I went and told my story on a Zoom on Monday with Tracy and a bunch of people. They were so amazing. And I cried throughout my whole story because of the shame I still feel to this day. Okay. I still feel a lot of shame to this day. I was watching another young lady's video. She brought up a really, really good point. You know, now that Texas has passed this abortion law where people can't get abortions passed I think six weeks, which is a month and two weeks pregnant. Think about all the women who struggle with addiction who don't even know their pregnant and don't find out until they're like two months, three months pregnant. And I'm telling you, you might say, how would you not know that you were pregnant for that long? Believe me, it's easy. When I found out I was pregnant, you guys, guess what? I was already 10 weeks pregnant. Two weeks, two months and two weeks pregnant. Okay. Like it's easy when you're using to not realize what's going on with your body. So this is going to cause an even bigger problem for women who are struggling with addiction. And that's why I speak out and share my story. You know, it's the hardest story to tell because I get judged horribly for it. But if I can help save just one woman and one child's life and help their family, then that's what I'm going to do.",

7314751226925813038,Replying to @Kourtney🌙 #pregnancy #pregnant #smoking #nicotine #dontsmoke #dontvape #addiction #withdrawals #cortisol #progesterone #support #positivity #sunsgodess ," I'm using a comment here that was accurate and at the same time not a bully or aggressive or a negative comment to kind of explain this because a lot of people seem to think that you should just instantly quit smoking the moment that you get pregnant. This is something that a lot of people need to understand, okay? I already have issues with my progesterone. One is the hormone that tells your body not to shed the lining of your uterus, hence not miscarry, not start contractions, not cause of stillbirth, all that kind of stuff, okay? That's progesterone. Your stress hormone is called cortisol. The primary hormone that your body needs in order to create cortisol is progesterone. What is the reason that women should not just up and quit smoking cold turkey when they are pregnant? They should lower that down so that their cortisol level does not go too high because if your cortisol level goes too high, it will use your progesterone that is keeping you pregnant in order to supply that stress hormone. So for all of you out there going, oh, I just quit. All good for you, you produce a large amount of progesterone and can handle that large cortisol load, not all women can. So basically, yes, you should probably smoke it if you're pregnant if you can. But you should also consider the fact that if that progesterone turns into cortisol because you just up and quit and you get too stressed out, then you end up in a position where you are harming your child, aka miscarrying, that's kind of the same as unalliving your child due to choosing to stress yourself out and raise your cortisol levels, which takes down your progesterone levels, which tells your body it's time to start your cycle because that is the whole job of progesterone in a pregnancy. If you don't believe me, please feel free to go look up the facts. I've done my research. I'm not going to do any more updates on the whole why you shouldn't just up and quit. And it's not like that. Like I said, for every woman, some women produce plenty of progesterone and can handle the cortisol. Some women can't. Women go through these withdrawals. These are withdrawals people go through when they quit. And all of these things raise your cortisol level. So please stop judging women who are doing their best to continue that pregnancy because just a stress alone is enough to end it. Anyway, have an appointment at 3. Hopefully, I will get some extra supports through that. Maybe that will help me to quit. But otherwise, I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing and keep trying to cut down as much as I can until I either quit or just get down to the lowest amount that I can keep my cortisol levels under control throughout the day. Otherwise, yeah, have a nice day. Everybody know I do not promote smoking while pregnant. I don't suggest to start. I don't suggest any way you smoke. I don't suggest anyone ever start smoking. It is the dumbest decision you will make. Okay. So, teenagers happen to stay long enough through this whole video. Don't smoke. Literally, dumbest decision you will make in your entire life. Don't vape either. It's worse than smoking. Much higher nicotine content. Anyway, love you all.","Human face, Clothing, Woman, Girl 2, KTOK, @RTok, runny nose,, Tok, RTok, JTok, CTok, CKTok, JRTOK, RTOk, O, @sunsgodess, @AKTok, 6, 00, AKTok, MTok, KTok, withdraws are.

What's that hanging out your pocket baby? Your vape? Okay where'd you get a vape from? Your dad gave it to you? Okay he bought it for you or he just gave it to you.

Well there's a few things I want to tell you and I just I just don't feel like you should be using them okay. They're not good for you and it can cause long-term effects that I don't think. You're 12 years old baby and I don't feel like a vape is the best option for you. Are you do you use it because I know you said this because it looks cool and it's addicting now so you can't stop but I feel like there's other things that you could try baby outside of a vape. Like what? What do you like? Do you do you like sports? You like to have sex and drink alcohol. Baby who do you do these things with? You're dad?,

7262709163137043744,"Replying to @Phia Dwyer 🌻  thank you for your comment, hope some people save this mindset switch. #nicotinewithdrawal #nicotinefree #snus #foryou #2weekfree "," So I wanted to respond to this comment and not because of the reason that a lot of people think well done for this by the way But I want to say that this was my number one reason and excuse constantly I used to say things like if I ever got pregnant to have to stop If I ever you know find out I'm gonna have a kid then I stop nicotine I just cold take it because I don't want my child to be nicotine addicted XYZ right? Let's just think about that for a second many people on nicotine Always talk about the day that they're gonna stop or the day that they're not going to have it anymore And this is very bold from me after two weeks But I'm seeing the light right now guys and seeing the realizations to the excuses that I was making if I knew in Myself that one day I was gonna quit then what was stopping me from actually quitting before Like if you already know you want to stop doing something Then you should just stop before you have no reasons between me now and me being pregnant There is still no reasons for me to take nicotine and I used to use that excuse constantly for myself I used to say like I know like I don't need it to do it right now like but if I ever got pregnant You know what yeah, I definitely stop but really like the same reason applies I just probably shouldn't be taking it probably just don't need to take it at all and This is one thing if you know that you want to stop eventually Then what is it that is stopping you right now from doing it and it can be so deeply in bed That which is one thing that I realized it's my routine. It's my feelings of anxiety And you know what's so crazy guys is that the biggest thing that happened since obviously stopping is I have had quite low moods But it's because I've constantly used this dopamine reward cycle to tell me how to feel if I'm sad It's nicotine if I'm happy. I'll let's have a nicotine It's controlled so much, but Whether I'm in a position where I'm pregnant whether I'm positioned where I'm not pregnant like whether I'm down the line I want to make a health change or whether it's five years from now. It's not gonna make a difference You just have to accept that this is probably something that you don't want to do anymore You have to change how you see it you need to change your routine and Reading the comments and talking about this again It has given me little triggers to think about it even more But if anything, let's just reiterate it the bigger fact that I don't need it because if this is helping other people And you know they want to make a change then cool like you should there's no point stall and something that you know you need to change And I genuinely believe that lifelong addiction and two weeks or three days going through withdrawals This one so much harder than this one so much harder you will still have to fight the cravings You will still have to fight the social pressures, but I think in general if you know you want to stop something down The more stop and you're doing it now",
7291089322843835690,Replying to @Kayla M. I got time today!!! 😘😘," Also, I quit smoking called Turkey when I got pregnant because I cared more about my baby than my habit, but anyway, well, Kayla, I've got time today. I get it. That was you. That was something you could have done. I'm sure the age factor is probably a little different. I'm sure the long-term smoking use is probably a little different. I'm sure there are a lot of things different about you than me because, guess what, we are not the fucking same. So, that being said, I get you quit smoking and I 100% commit you on that. I quit taking my Zanex. I quit taking my Adderall. Both of those were subscriptions, not sub-subscriptions, but prescriptions that I had been prescribed for years. But don't nobody want to talk about that. We just going to talk about the fact that I had a baby in my damn hand and the fact that I am trying to win myself off of it. But we ain't talking about that. We're not going to talk about the fact that I do eat a lot healthier and drink a hell of a lot more water than I ever did before. I got pregnant. But we ain't going to talk about that. But are we going to talk about the fact that you feed your kidney? Have you done your research into fast food? That is actually the number one leaving calls in child obesity. You know, I'm not saying your kids are big so don't even go there on me because I'm not the fucking one. I'm talking about you doing things this great for your children because you care about them more than you do the habits. Eating a lot of fast food is a bad habit. I'm not saying you do that a lot. I'm just saying that you posted the video of the McDonald's, McChicken, so much so I love Mc Donald's. So, they're here. They make better choices. You can cook chicken nuggets at home. Have you seen how Mc Donald's chicken nuggets are made? Have you ever watched that show? How this is made or whatever? Have you seen it? It's actually a fucking paste. It is like the pieces of the chicken that are just like shit. And I've watched videos where they've taken microscopic slices or very thin slices of weenies and stuff like that and put it on a microscope. They've found hair in that shit. They have found small pieces of glass in that shit but you feed it to your kids. So ma'am, before you come over here trying to be all big bad, don't, because I'm not, I mean I am. I got time today. I might not give you the response you won't waste me but I got time to fucking day. So, go on that bullshit. I'm missing my bullshit. My life is different. Everybody can do different shit. So what might work for you might not work for the next person. I commend you again for quit smoking. I wish I fucking could quit vaping but god damn. I quit the new ports. Can I get a pet on the back for that? Antirate if I hear other comment about what is wrong for someone to tell someone what's right. I got door dash hold on. 100% lost my trying to talk because I thought that was my crumble cookies but it wasn't. Anyway, how you said something about it so is wrong that I point out about telling that woman not to go somewhere without sunscreen. That's common sense too. So I shouldn't be smoking while I'm pregnant, common sense. But she shouldn't go out and saw what else on screen. Common fucking sense. Especially when you paste your white. Common fucking sense.",

7286225779006999840,Replying to @Sophie ," So this is a comment on a video that I have made about smoking during pregnancy. Now in this video I'm saying that it's unfair, it's an unfair sound, right? And that's not me saying that if you smoke during pregnancy you deserve stillbirth or miscarriage. That's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that it's unfair because while there are people that do everything right, they can experience the most traumatic thing that no mother should ever have to experience right. And that comes with miscarriage stillbirth, whatever. And there are people that inflict harm on their babies and have a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby. And like I said, that's not me saying that their baby deserves to die and that it would bring back to Rome or whatever that's not what I'm saying. Like it's a simple fact that I don't understand how the world works because while there's someone that's literally inflicting no pain on their unborn baby and doing everything right, no harm, quick smoking, doesn't drink, doesn't do any of that stuff. How would they then the one with the unlucky stick? Like it doesn't make any sense to me. And as someone who has experienced child loss, a late term loss, it is obviously really like heartful to see like if I'm walking down the street and I see a pregnant woman, like that was as pregnant as I was when I lost Rome, like literally at the end, smoking a cigarette, like that's going to like tick something in me, like I don't like that because like that basically there was someone in the comments that said, that it can happen regardless. Yes, it can happen regardless. Obviously that's just common knowledge. But you are increasing your risk by doing something that puts you and your baby at risk. And for this person who's literally in the comments, admitting that they smoke when they're pregnant, I would have really said, I don't engage in conversation with you because I think that's vile and you can all come from me in the comments if you want to come from me. I actually don't care that is disgusting. I mean it's bad enough that you're doing it anyway but like you're putting it on a public platform and you're openly saying it with no shame. And for any person who thinks that smoking doesn't cause harm to your baby, please just look at this. The cigarette smoke creates a shortage of oxygen. In other words, he's not getting enough air. Does that make you want to quit? Yeah. Obviously my video was old. It's a long time ago, but science is still science and that is still a valid fact. Like that doesn't just change. That literally happens to your baby in the womb. And if smoking already has so many negative effects on people that smoke, can you imagine the effects that it has to an unborn baby that is in the process of grubbing? Like they're not even fully developed yet. And the reason why this annoys me so much, and like I said, you can all come from me, but when I was in hospital with Roman, I was really, really ill, yeah. And I mean like very ill, I was in there for weeks and weeks. My sister who has this relates to my other video, she has children in the care system. She's got three in the care system. She's got one with my mom. She's taken adoption of her. I don't know if I made it to her. She's adopted her. So she's with her. And she didn't fight for them back, but she kept having more. I don't agree with that. I don't understand that. And when I got really ill, I went up to the delivery suite. I'm sorry, the delivery ward, whatever, went up there. And I was in room seven and she was in room six. I didn't know that she was there because none of us knew she was pregnant again. And that was when I had obviously found out that she was having another baby. And she was drinking red bulls, never saw her drink her glass of water when she was at a drink of water. She was continuously smoking and she ended up having her baby pre-time. So it was pre-time labour by I think it was six weeks or something. And her baby was potentially at a risk. I don't know too much about it. I don't know whether she was completely healthy or she had things wrong with her, but she was pre-term and she didn't take care of herself or her body. And this is from someone that literally did not care about her children whatsoever. And I'm in the room next to her, heavily pregnant, obviously a few weeks over her at that point. And she had given birth. Her baby then was put in care. And my baby ended up dying a few weeks after that, full-time. And I did absolutely everything right. And that's why comments like this really riled me. Like I actually can't because like do you know how hurtful that is as well? Like your own sister. I mean like the same ward as this girl and we're next door to each other. And I can hear her laboring her baby. And her baby just gets shoved in the care system. And my baby dies. Like what? And I obviously wanted room and he would have been in such a loving home and he would have been taking care of so well. And he never got to have that opportunity. And there are people like that that don't care about their children. Don't care about the wellbeing of themselves that are when they're a bum baby and pops kids out like their tic-tacs. And it's just more kids in the care system for other people to look after. And while I tried to adopt her after I lost room, I then for pregnant again. And I wasn't in a position to be able to do that. So she's now in care. And that is why it annoys me. And like I said, if you smoke when you're pregnant, I please don't speak to me. I'm not interested.",

We love her, don't we? Yes, we do. However, doing pregnancy is a fine line. I get it. I got family members that smoke while they were pregnant. I know moms that smoke while they're pregnant or they're not necessarily may not smoke. You might have them these because cannabis comes in all kinds of forms, right? You can smoke it. You can eat it. You can drink it, especially if you live in California, you can use it as a ball and rub it on your body. You can use it as a droplet. Like cannabis comes in different forms and different dosages. It's used for so many different holistic things, right? And I am all for it. However, you have to remember that when you are pregnant, you are utilized in a hospital system that has liabilities, right? So if you have an opiate, they don't want to be liable. If something happens, right? You have up to 18 years to sue these doctors. If something happens during your delivery, during your pregnancy with your baby. But if you pop on a piss test, you know the first thing they're going to say is that this mom was the drug addict or this mom used drugs. They're going to throw you under the bus. This, so that's one of the things that I encourage my mom to really think about when it comes to cannabis use. If you are going to be using a provider who insists on testing you, drug testing you for cannabis or who insists that they don't like on not allowing or not necessarily allowing, but like in their patients to utilize cannabis products. Okay, so that's where betting your your provider comes in. You have to vet your provider. You have to properly vet your provider, right? You have to ask the question that need to be asked so that you can have a safe delivery, so that you can have a safe pregnancy. So proper vetting of your provider, proper vetting of your facility where you're going to deliver it, because even as a labor nurse, when you come in to us and we go through your prenatal practice, and we see that you have a positive urine drug screen at any time during your pregnancy, we are supposed to drug screen you at the hospital and drugs screen your baby. Right? So like even if you only pounce on your piss test, you're first appointment and we all know that first appointment you're going to like, and that's what we do. We get your love work, we get your urine because we're testing for other things too. Don't eat it, this is true. However, we are doing your drug screen on you, and that's the first time you pop on your piss test and you find, you know, so you're like, okay, well I'm pregnant, so I have a small or you know, utilize cannabis since I took the pregnancy test and it was positive and you come in for your to have your baby nine at 10 months later. Here we are trying to drug screen you again. Let me let you know this, you can refuse. Did you know? Did you know? Did you know? Did you know? What you can refuse urine drug screen, especially if you know you only use THC and you know that you're going to stop using THC or even if you don't stop using THC doing your pregnancy, you can refuse the urine drug screen on yourself. When you come into the liver, you can refuse the urine drug screen on your baby because they will slap a pee bag on that baby quick. You know what I mean? To test them for THC. Why? Not only that, we are supposed to contact social services if you test positive for any kind of drugs during delivery when you come in to the hospital. Okay, so just know that you can refuse these things. You don't have to allow them to test you. Now if you're smoking crack, are you doing math or a heroin or whatever, you're doing some old outrageous ass shit. Like come on sis, don't come on, come on, come on. Come on. In the... Anyways, just know you do not have to be drug screened. Okay, stand your ground. All right? All right guys. That's it! That's all I got today!",

I started smunking when she was, um, three months into college. The day I was in the smunker show, I won't ask if she started. I know a quarter of her. So I found she's pregnant. I went to some church. I don't know what one it is. Well, I asked her to find out. I just found a church thing, where they help people. They're pregnant women that are struggling with that smunker. Um, let's give you that. Let's give you that. Let's give you that. And there's a midwife who can just test. They can do it. I don't know if it's like, uh, I don't know what it is. I do a test on here. And, um, that level, that the smunker, the stuff has dropped down. She's on the bike. What a f**k I should do here. What the hell is that class?","Human face, Man pregnant?

This sparks a furious fan debate. But guys, I don't even know what the debate is. The fact of the matter is, if you're pregnant, you should not be smoking or drinking alcohol period. I mean, I've already talked about the disgusting things that Blueface has already done. Like having strippers in the middle of his living room and making his, you know, little son, watch it, and if he doesn't watch it, he calls him names. And that was Baby Mama's smoking while she's pregnant. This is just some disgusting, degenerate behavior. Like when you are pregnant, you are not only taking the responsibility of your life, but also another person's life as well. So you need to put your addictions aside. You need to put all your wants and desires aside and make sure you're taking care of that baby. So I don't know how there's any debate on this. Like who is arguing like, yeah, it's okay to do this while you're pregnant. No, it's not. And it never will be okay. I mean, if you disagree with me, let me know down in the comments so you can expose yourself. But guys, this is just disgusting behavior.

7279805549007342890,Caught my Girlfriend smoking while pregnant!!! #girlfriend #redditstories #foryou ," I caught my girlfriend smoking while pregnant. Should I forgive her, or is it enough reason to break up? Alright, so first things first. She's pregnant for the second time after we had a miscarriage on 1-4 July. Now she got pregnant again, and the same stuff is happening, bleeding and probably a miscarriage. Now she got upset of course, but we had an ultrasound since she wasn't sure and wanted to see if everything was okay. The ultrasound came back saying the baby was probably around 5-6 weeks old. This is possible since, after a miscarriage, the ovulation can be off as well. We expected the baby to be around 8 weeks, so it was a bit of a shock. We're going back again in a week to see if the baby is growing or if it's staying the same. Now she was stressed of course, but she grabbed a cigarette to deal with the stress. After we found out she was pregnant, we both quit straight away. Now I feel like she's risking the life of the baby, who probably is already in a rough spot for the little kick of a cigarette. I don't know what to do. We had a conversation, obviously, where kind of kept saying, you don't need to tell me how bad it is, where I'm more like, I think I do, if you really knew you wouldn't have done it. Anything I do seems to calm me down. Some advice would be awesome. Thanks in advance.",
7104080474313674030,tooting my own horn over here 🚂 #quitvaping #nicotinefree #fyp #pregnancy #pregnancytiktok #pregnancyjourney #6weekspregnant #genderrevealideas #helpmeplease @savannuhhb," So I don't mean to treat my own horn or anything, but I'm nicotine free all the way. I will never vape again. I will never touch a vape again. I will never think about a vape again. I am so excited. You have no idea. So obviously I've been nicotine free since like four weeks ago now, but I did buy the Nicarite gum or like the off brand Nicarite gum just so I didn't send my body into shock and I have not chewed a piece of that gum in like three days now. So that's pretty good. I'm pretty proud of myself about that. But what I'm really proud of myself is I haven't even thought about it today. I haven't had a craving for nicotine. I haven't, like it just, it isn't there and I'm so excited. I'm so thankful because I thought I didn't think it was going to go away. But if you have the same, if you're going through this or you are addicted to a vape like half of you are, I know that you know what it feels like. Anyways, it's the best feeling to not have to vlog around a stupid vape with you everywhere you go. It's the best feeling. On to the good stuff. Baby is six weeks in a day today. Everything is great. My morning sickness has subsided a little bit. I did throw up this morning but I haven't been nauseous as much as I have and I've definitely been able to eat more than I was because I was like, ugh, food, no. But it's going good. We have another appointment, not this Thursday but the next to hear baby's heartbeat and do more tests. And it's just a more thorough appointment. Our last one, we were super early so we just kind of confirmed the pregnancy, the due day and do's and don'ts, pre-annual vitamins, things like that. So we are going to do a gender review I think. I don't know what we're going to do yet. I need help. I don't know what to do. I don't want to do something that too many would do or that's like silly. I just want to do something good, cute, find it out, know what it is and move on. You know? If you have any suggestions or any cute ideas, please let me know. And I think Cooper knows, our dog knows something's going on or there's baby here because he is acting super funny. He wants to lay on me all the time, like right over my belly, gets right up super close to it. He won't really pounce on me as much as he used to when we play and is really careful to jump on me. So I think he knows.",

7307960058996968747,#tooltips #reddit #tooltiktok #redditstories #scary #askreddit ," smokers, how did you overcome your addiction to cigarettes? So it all started with my mother. She smoked most of her life. She definitely didn't let up when she was pregnant with me. I was born under weight, as is typical. I was breastfed, and when she tried to wean me, I started having startling symptoms. Shaking, screening. She thought I was having a seizure. Dr. Set I was going through nicotine withdrawal as a baby. I was jonesing for my nicotine fixed to the point I'd bully my younger brother off the honker. I got at least a good two solid years of breastfeeding, monopolizing it to the point where my mom got so sick of breastfeeding that she took my brother off early. Smoking was in the house constantly. I always wanted to sit by mommy when she smoked. The fumes were a part of my life. I started officially smoking at 12. All my friends coughing? Evan casuals, I ripped the filters off because that's how mommy do. I moved on from those Virginia slums to Marbara with the filters ripped off. By the time I was 16 I decided to come out with my habit to my mother because I figured only an idiot couldn't tell I was a smoker. I mean, she could even smell it because of the brand change. Well, she cried, yelled and I was just staring at her dunk-founded. She tried her best to make me feel like a worthless, weak piece of crap for picking up this habit that she tried so hard to shield me from and that she raised me better. Then she lights a cigarette up and says look how much you've stressed me out. This is coming from the woman that when I begged her to quit when I was younger she screamed in my face that this was one thing in her life that she could enjoy. So, she verbally and emotionally abuses me from this point out. Your room smells disgusting because you smoke. I'm going to start smoking outside because I don't want this house to smell like crap. Yeah, that lasted a week. Anyways, I turned 18 soon after. I officially and legally can smoke. Mum, start sending me off to pick up the smokes. When life gives lemons you make lemonade I guess. She also never, never let me off the hook. Always had something to say about me smoking and how she wasn't as bad. I smoked those menthol ones for a bit. Started coughing up lead. Decided to stop those. I stopped eating much. I then lived off of cigarettes and Dr. Pepper. Leading to me dropping to 94 pounds. So then I turned 19. I met a guy who doesn't smoke. I decided that year I'm going to quit. My mum, desperate to somehow keep on some level with me, says she's going to do it too. Well my boyfriend helped me quit. I used the patches for about two weeks. Then I just got effing tired of using them so I stopped them and went cold turkey. My mum fell off the wagon and tried to hide it from me but with me getting my sense of smell back, as well as her coughing up chunks of tar, I could smell it all over her. She then started trying to control my life more. She now doesn't want to let me go anywhere and says I have to stay home and watch my brother. I ran away from home when I was 20 and didn't talk to her a few years because she insisted on keeping the relationship toxic. I now haven't smoked in nearly 10 years, but I still dream of cigarettes. It's still a struggle. I think about going back to it all the time.","Palm Tree, Human hand, Table, Plant, Person, Car, Poster, Flower, Banana, Clothing, Cocktail, Wine Glass, Pen, Helmet, Toy, Woman, Box, Perfume, Door, Chair, Tree 10 11 12 13, 19, C TiKTOk, Were, Pounds, A, Much, Never, incco, Younger, Blood, Addiction, Tried, Smoking, House, Wean, Tool_Tips, Well, Honker, 250MM, From, d TikTok, Constantly, It, 9, Me, As, EPMAK, Crt, Could, e, N, c TikTok, Got, A Ba, TikTOk, For, Week, to, That, Feel, :, Desperate, With, Face, Emotionally, Who, C TikTok, Still, 18, Enjoy, Relationship, Started, Also, EV, Disgusting, d TikTOk, Those, OZ 61 81 21 91 SL P EL, Out, C TikTOk, I'M, TikTok, Something, Then, Life, Going, Start, 10 11 12, Shatterproof, Them, Typical, Officially, Symptoms, 12087, Least, 12, Monopolizing, Took, Have, Mommy, Brand, Mother, Of, 6, Virginia, Smokers, Weak, Up, o TikTok, X, Insisted, 10 11, 1 OL, Dumbfounded, P, a, An, -, 3, Crap, Smoked, Went, Chunksous, Pepper, Better, Early, Casuals, Come, Seizure, To, So, After, @sereddit90, Sick, Back, d ikTok, Friends, TiKTOk, Didn'T, ^, Sh, C, Her, I, Is, Picking, Toxic, J, The, 07 6181 21 91 CL, Shaking, Smoke, 1cdie, Hook, And, Mom, Begged, Patches, Cried, =, On, Dropping, 16 17 18 19, Breastfed, Lights, When, Decided, Look, Withdrawal, S, Filters, Years, Lemons, 16 17 18 19 2, My, Point, d, Outside, SUBSCRIBE, Moved, Most, Off, Weeks, 1, CTikTok, ~, Quit, Was, Guess, Cigarettes"

7308297938629922091,#tooltips #reddit #tooltiktok #redditstories #scary #askreddit ," X-smokers, how did you overcome your addiction to cigarettes? So it all started with my mother. She smoked most of her life. She definitely didn't let up when she was pregnant with me. I was born under weight, as is typical. I was breastfed, and when she tried to wean me, I started having startling symptoms. Shaking, screening. She thought I was having a seizure. Dr. Set I was going through nicotine withdrawal as a baby. I was jonesing for my nicotine fixed to the point I'd bully my younger brother off the honker. I got at least a good two solid years of breastfeeding, monopolizing it to the point where my mom got so sick of breastfeeding that she took my brother off early. Smoking was in the house constantly. I always wanted to sit by mommy when she smoked. The fumes were a part of my life. I started officially smoking at 12. All my friends coughing? Evan Casuals, I ripped the filters off because that's how mommy do. I moved on from those Virginia slums to Marborough with the filters ripped off. By the time I was 16 I decided to come out with my habit to my mother because I figured only an idiot couldn't tell I was a smoker. I mean, she could even smell it because of the brand change. Well, she cried, yelled and I was just staring at her dunk-founded. She tried her best to make me feel like a worthless, weak piece of crap for picking up this habit that she tried so hard to shield me from and that she raised me better. Then she lights a cigarette up and says look how much you've stressed me out. This is coming from the woman that when I begged her to quit when I was younger she screamed in my face that this was one thing in her life that she could enjoy. So, she verbally and emotionally abuses me from this point out. Her room smells disgusting because you smoke. I'm going to start smoking outside because I don't want this house to smell like crap. Yeah that lasted a week. Anyways I turned 18 soon after. I officially and legally can smoke. Mum. Start sending me off to pick up the smokes. When life gives lemons you make lemonade I guess. She also never, never let me off the hook. Always had something to say about me smoking and how she wasn't as bad. I smoked those menthol ones for a bit. Started coughing up lead. Decided to stop those. I stopped eating much. I then lived off of cigarettes and Dr. Pepper. Leading to me dropping to 94 pounds. So then I turned 19. I met a guy who doesn't smoke. I decided that year I'm going to quit. My mum, desperate to somehow keep on some level with me, says she's going to do it too. Well my boyfriend helped me quit, I used the patches for about two weeks. Then I just got effing tired of using them so I stopped them and went cold turkey. My mum fell off the wagon and tried to hide it from me but with me getting my sense of smell back, as well as her coughing up chunks of tar. I could smell it all over her. She then started trying to control my life more. She now doesn't want to let me go anywhere and says I have to stay home and watch my brother. I ran away from home when I was 20 and didn't talk to her a few years because she insisted on keeping the relationship toxic. I now haven't smoked in nearly 10 years. But I still dream of cigarettes. It's still a struggle. I think about going back to it all the time.","Pen, Flower, Tin can, Poster, Book, Car, Perfume, Watch, Bottle, Bird, Clothing, Ladder, Human hand, Food, Tower, Box, Person ACIER, yasyo cOpot, SHANGHAI HARDEN TOOLS CO.LTD, J Tiktok, 19, Kpennee dod, Te, PyuHan nuna, Cool_Tips, TEL +86-21-52600666, Pounds, Were, skin and, A, Much, Houep nagnet,, ------, HACTWY, E, Never, Younger, 220z, L, www.harden-tools.com, Blood, MR, Addiction, 16 15 1, O TOOCTH, Tried, Smoking, Honker, House, Tool_Tips, Well, ter, 127-41.28 T/CM, Wean, 200131.0, From, 615 14, d TikTok, Constantly, It, 9, TO, HARDEN, WERNER, |, Me, IN, As, Could, Bad, Lifetime item No 63016, c TikTok, H H BT, Got, Topl_Tips, anger., 2 Foor No d .ing #29 .

7326664545395625258,This is the most effective way to treat an addiction. 🙏🏼#lifeadvice #lifetips #lifelessons #lifelesson #lifecoach #lifecoaching #addiction #sober #sobriety #soberliving #lifetip ," Okay, so I get addicted to caffeine. Well, why am I addicted to caffeine? There's a solution for energy. So I get addicted to drinking at night. What was the solution to? Maybe to bond, maybe to connect, maybe to chill out. It was a solution to something else. So if you work backwards from there and go, what was this person trying to solve in their life with this addiction, this habit that they can no longer break? Then you can work backwards and if you can get to the actual problem, a lot of times the problem or the addiction will drop off on its own. It's like a mother, I wish I could say this happens all the time, but more often than not, a woman gets pregnant, that smokes, smoking drops immediately. They'll pick it up right after pregnancy, but while they're pregnant, it's like, why? Because that value, the solution that they were gaining from whatever they were trying to fix is overridden by, I'm now gonna be a parent. The child means something more to me.",

Obviously, now I'm here at Food Basics to do my grocery shopping, but I had to hop on here and say this because it was a video about the effects of vaping. And I felt the need to come on here because I am a fellow vapor. Now, backstory, I started smoking cigarettes when I was 19 regularly. I wouldn't say that I was a heavy smoker. Like, I wasn't like a pack of day kind of person, but I was probably at least a pack of a half in a week. Which I know it's not healthy. I know it's bad for you. Like, I know I've had the talk. Like, I know. Then when I was trying to get pregnant, I quit because I'm like, obviously I'm not going to smoke during my pregnancy. Let's get this out of the way. Now, cold turkey like done. Like, you know, and it wasn't easy. It was really, really, really hard. And I found that because it's an addiction, it was just like something that I, you know, like I would just contribute it to like when I was driving and like when I was stressed and blah, blah, blah, blah. After I had my daughter, I still didn't smoke cigarettes like for a long, long time. I think I tried it a few times or something and it was like disgusting. Even now, when I smell cigarette smoke, like it gives me like a freaking migraine. So I went to vaping and I vaped with like an open system. So like you would pour the liquid in and it would heat up and there was all the smoke and blah, blah, blah, blah. And I did that for a few months. I tried different ones out and like honestly, it was worse than smoking. It was so bad for my lungs. Like, I was getting chronic lung infections and just like, I don't know. I just didn't, I felt like it was worse than when I smoked cigarettes. And like, I'm not a healthcare professional or anything. So don't quote me on this, but I'm just telling you my experience with all this kind of stuff. Now I do, I'm not going to show it, but I do the views go disposable vapes. I got them at the gas station. And they're not any better. I've probably been using them for like a year and I'm not saying that they're better for you. And I do still have certain effects. I think it's just like you smoke anything into your lungs. It's bad. It's definitely one of the better solutions in my opinion for myself. People sit there and say, well, don't you know the health effects of vaping like, you know, you're basically killing yourself. I am aware, but coming from somebody who smoked cigarettes for 10 years and I would also shisha on top of that probably once, twice a week, I don't even hit my vape that much like in comparison. And I literally have a cutoff time that I don't smoke my vape at night. Like, and I don't even really smoke it all day long. Like I would have when I smoked cigarettes. So, you know, what in my opinion, I think it is better for me in my lungs. I know this is probably going to start a little bit of controversy in the comment section or whatever, but I'm just telling you my personal experience with it because you know, I feel like people harp so much on people who smoke cigarettes, people harp so much on people who smoke vapes. But what about people that smoke marijuana? What about people that do other like drugs? Like bad drugs? What about people that have drinking problems? What about people that have eating problems and or obese? Like everybody has their vice. It doesn't matter. Some people, they go to the gym and they overwork themselves and they don't eat. Like that's not healthy either. Like I just think that people need to stop coming after smokers. Like whether it's vaping or whatever, like because you know what? Like, again, everyone has their vice. And like to be honest with you, there's people that have had long, like problems or whatever and they don't even smoke. Maybe a secondhand smoke, but I'm just saying, if you guys think that the food you put into your body, like let's say you're healthy, you don't smoke, you don't drink nothing. What makes you better than somebody who smokes? Like the food that you put into your body is just as bad. You know, how much crap is in food now? All the chemicals that are in food nowadays? Like the pollution that's in the air that we breathe in every day. Like people get cancer from literally living a super healthy lifestyle and people are like, oh my god, like, well, I don't know what happened. And like of course, sometimes things happen. You can't control it. It's in jeans. It's just you get a shitty hand. Like it's unfortunate. But don't come after people who vape or smoke or whatever because you know what? The end of the day, everybody has their vice. We're all going to die and no offense, but is it really like your business? Like I, you know, I personally, when I was a smoker, I only smoked around fellow smokers. I didn't smoke around people who didn't smoke. I didn't want to give them second, thirdhand smoke. Of course not. But the point is, it's just like I see all these videos now about vaping and it used to be about smoking cigarettes. And I'm like, you know what? There is so many people out there that have their own vices like people over eat, people over drink, people do drugs, hard drugs, people over smoke. Yes, 100%. Some people are, they over do it 100%. Some people, they freaking abuse prescription drugs. Like, hello, it's just like if you're going to come after the vapors, like, you know what? Come after all the unhealthy things that people do to themselves. And you know what? There might be some people like my mom is super healthy. She still has a glass of wine a couple times a week. That's apparently not healthy anymore. Like you make, you shoot your own battles, right? I'm just saying. So coming after the vapors for it, you know, I know it's a popular trend that's going on, but you know what? Like that's up to people to teach their children right from wrong. And at the end of the day, you can't control everything in other people's lives and society. And at the end of the day, like who's really marketing the shit? Who is, did I invent the vape? No. The government invents these kind of things and then sells them and markets them and advertises them to the population. So if we really didn't want people doing all these bad things, why do we have LCBOs? Why do we have dispensaries on every corner? Why is there vape stores everywhere? Like, what? Where's the really the root of the problem? You know, why are people turning to these things? Why are people overeating? Why is there chemicals in our foods? Why are they promoting junk food? Like, I'm just saying, it really ticks me off.",

7297634592809323822,Will You Stop? #success #motivation #mindset #health ," vaping is terrible because of the other chemicals that delivers to the lungs. Vaping is associated with disruptions in egg health and what they call egg quality can create certain mutations in eggs and serious endocrine issues in women. Personally, I find it disgusting. I don't do it, but when I see people vaping, vaping is so addictive. It's a mutagen. It mutates the genes of cells. It mutates the genes of rapidly dividing cells most. So breast cancers, ovarian cancers, egg quality, sperm are constantly turning over. So people always say, oh, well, I vape all the time and I got so-and-so pregnant or whatever. When I say I have a probably healthy kid, that kid might have been much healthier. And also the kid's not grown up yet, like introducing me to the kid later. I wish for that kid, I pray for them, but that their healthy is can be. But it is so clear that you're introducing a laundry list of toxins to the lungs and they're getting into the bloodstream and there are a number of them that cross the blood brain barrier. And once they cross the blood brain barrier, those neurons, by virtue of the fact that neurons don't turn over across the lifespan, you burn with the ones you're going to die with. They might add a few across your lifespan, but you're mostly born with the ones that you're going to die with. Well, they're going to harbor those chemicals and those particulates. I can't find one good reason why people should vape.",

Vaping is associated with disruptions in egg health and what they call egg quality can create certain mutations in eggs and serious endocrine issues in women. Vaping is so addictive, it mutates the genes of cells, it mutates the genes of rapidly dividing cells, so breast cancers, ovarian cancers, egg quality, sperm are constantly turning over, so people always say, oh, I vape all the time and I got so-and-so pregnant or whatever, you know, when we say, I have a perfectly healthy kid, that kid might have been much healthier and also the kid's not grown up yet, like introducing me to the kid later. I wish for that kid, I pray for them, but that their healthy is can be, but it is so clear that you're introducing a laundry list of toxins to the lungs and they're getting into the bloodstream and there are a number of them that cross the blood brain barrier.",

7217886418092182826,Replying to @chefodaman Is it illegal to sell Vape Juice to a pregnant woman at the store?," When I sell vape juice to a pregnant person, let me tell you. Okay, so it's not illegal to sell vape juice to a pregnant woman. It's not illegal to sell cigarettes to a pregnant woman. It's not illegal to sell anything to a pregnant woman if she's over the age of 21. If she's a fucking teen mom, that's a different story. But if she's over 21, she can buy whatever she wants. Whatever she puts in her body while pregnant is not my fucking, not my obligation to prevent. Right? And me as a moral person, what I do it, the answer is yeah, because, right? If she vapes as a mom, chances are she's not going to be that precise of a mom figure, and the kid's going to be raised to be a dipshit anyway. So might as well have the vape be the excuse of why he's a dipshit, not the shitty parenting. So if a mom wants to drink smoke or fucking do vapes during a pregnancy, I'm not going to prevent this.

7130316331148168490,Three things I would avoid #medicaltiktok #thingstoavoid #vaping #pregnancytiktok #doctorsoftiktok," So I'm going to jump on this trend and give you three things that I would avoid given my knowledge of medicine. So the first thing I would avoid is vaping. So vaping has not been around for that long, so we don't know the long term effects of it. However, what we do know is that nicotine is highly addictive and it's not good for your heart. The other thing we know is that there have been some vaping associated lung in threes, so it's just best to avoid. The second thing that I would avoid is popping a pimple in this area of the face, which is called the triangle of death. And the reason it's called that is because infections from this area of the face can more easily travel to the brain given their shared blood supplies, so don't pop pimples there. And then the last thing I would avoid is getting pregnant. So for much human history, pregnancy and childbirth was super dangerous with a 1 to 2% mortality rate. Obviously it's a lot more safe now, but it is still one of the most dangerous things that women can do.",

I'm actually like so sad about it because in the beginning of summer, I was the lowest weight that I had ever been since having my son. I felt the most like myself. I was finally like fitting into my pre-pregnancy clothing. I was feeling really good and I quit vaping and now I've gained like 10 pounds. The body dysmorphia that I have, I'm just gonna be real since having my son is really hard. I'm trying to work through it. It's really hard to see your body change so much after you have a child. So anyway, I guess just so y'all know if you quit vaping, you're gonna gain.

7326769598227893512,Im obviously not the smartest. #fyp #foryou #breastfeeding #babybangzjrny #ediesjrny #vaping #nicotine #health ," I have officially stopped breastfeeding. This is a huge L on my part. I was unaware that nicotine could go into your breast milk. I thought it was just like the chemicals in nicotine. It could stick to your skin, to your clothes, in your breath. So I was doing everything I needed to avoid those kind of things, but I was unaware that breast milk was affected by nicotine. I gave some advice to some lady who commented on my TikTok. Maybe the week before last week, she was asking for some advice about vaping and looking after a baby. And clearly, my advice was wrong because I was telling her things like brush your teeth, wear jumpers when you've vaped and take it off when you look after baby, have something to eat or drink to kind of dim it down. That was stupid. And Owens brother also asked who like while was vaping because I'm breastfeeding baby. And I said, well, the nicotine doesn't go into the breast milk. It just sticks to you. People said to weigh at least 90 minutes before breastfeeding, but I have chosen to stop breastfeeding altogether, just because I'm not eating healthily and I'm not drinking healthily. So I am always having junk food and snacking on things and I'm not drinking any water at all. So regardless of my vaping, my breast milk is still unhealthy. I also have gotten Alan to try my breast milk and he said it's very sweet. I don't know why I thought that the food and drinks go straight to your breast milk. But then I'm pointed out that it just comes straight out your ass so it's obviously the body absorbing it and then that's kind of when I realize that everything that you intake goes into the breast milk.","Human face, Woman, Butterfly, Clothing 90 MINUTES BEFORE, AT, JUST BECAUSE IM NOT EATING, AND I SAID THE NICOTINE DOESN T, I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST LIKE, WRONG BECAUSE I WAS TELLING, AND TAKE IT OF WHEN YOU LOOK, OUT YOUR ASS, SHE WAS ASKING FOR SOME, AND YOUR BREATH, 279:, I HAVE OFFICIALLY STOPPED, UM SO I WAS DOING EVERYTHING, QTOT, AFTER BABY HAVE SOMETHING TO, d TikTok, ATOT, @ediesjrny, AT2T, BREASTFEEDING ALTOGETHER, HEALTHLY AND IC NOT DENENG, ABSORBING IT, THAT WAS STUPID, BREASTFEEDING, 17T9T, ANS BROTHER ALSO ASKED, 9T2T, & TikTok, THAT I NEEDED TO, TikTOk, C TikTOK, (NOT WRONG BUT NOT COMPLETELY RIGHT EHER), T93, COULD GO INTO YOUR BREAST MILK, UNHEALTHY, NICOTINE, Tik Tok, AND CLEARLY MY ADVICE WAS, J ALSO HAVE GOTTEN ALAN TO, UH I GAVE SOME ADVICE TO SOME, MILK, C TikTok, AT23, MY BREAST MILK IS STILL, GT97, I'M BREASTFEEDING BABY, TRY MY BREAST MILK, ITS JUST IT JUST STICKS TO YOU, d TikTOk, HEALTHLY AND IM NOT BENKING, I DONT KNOW WHY, AND THEN THATS KIND OF WHEN I, LADY WHO COMMENTED ON MY, C TikTOk, SO IT S OBVIOUSLY THE BODY, TikTok, o TikTOk, ITOT, WEEK, BREAST MILK, TO AVOID THOSE KIND OF THINGS, AND ALANS BROTHER ALSO ASKED, IM BREASTFEEDING BABY, AT9T, I THOUGHT THAT THE FOOD AND, ADVICE ABOUT VAPING AND, BUT I HAVE CHOSEN TO STOP, TiTOK, AND TAKE IT OFF WHEN YOU LOOK, Tiklok, ATO, LIKE WHY I WAS VAPING BECAUSE, TO KIND OF DIM IT DOWN, GOOGLE SAID TO WAIT AT LEAST, BUT THEN ALAN POINTED OUT, THAT IT JUST COMES STRAIGHT, O TikTOk, WEAR JUMPERS WHEN YOU VAPE, AND IM NOT DRINKING ANY WATER, HER THINGS LIKE, o TikTok, SO ITS OBVIOUSLY THE BODY, (NOT WRONG BUT NOT COMPLETELY RIGHT EITHER), DRINKS GO STRAIGHT TO YOUR, AT9, TO YOUR CLOTHES, ITOE, REALIZED, THIS IS A HUGE L ON MY PART, 3 TiKTOK, dTikTok, SAID ITS VERY SWEET, AT ALL, INTAKE GOES INTO THE BREAST, LOOKING AFTER A BABY, 2T2T, AND HE SAID ITS VERY SWEET, THE CHEMICALS AND NICOTINE, MAYBE THE WEEK BEFORE LAST, CTiKTOK, I WAS UNAWARE THAT NICOTINE, THAT EVERYTHING THAT YOU, BRUSH YOUR TEETH, HEALTHILY, d rkrok, SO REGARDLESS OF MY VAPING, BREAST MILK WAS AFFECTED BY, BUT I WAS UNAWARE THAT, T9T, T9, ikTok, AT2, TIKTOK, 0, FOOD AND SNACKING ON THINGS, GO INTO THE BREAST MILK, THAT COULD STICK TO YOUR SKIN, SO I AM ALWAYS HAVING JUNK, I ALSO HAVE GOTTEN ALAN TO, O TikTOK, T27, EAT OR DRINK"

You have to be one evil human being to think its funny to watch a child cough up smoke (which hurts) or to even hand them something and put something into their body that would harm them. I could never ever do that to my baby boy or anyone elses children no matter the age. I will never understand people like this. My heart breaks for that sweet boy and i hope they find someone who truley loves him and gives him the proper care he needs.  #fypシ #anniedonovan #sad #heartbreaking #infant #prayersneeded #spreadawareness #foryoupage #foryou   ," How could you sit there and look me in the face?

It's also very clear and we haven't released this episode yet, but I talked to a female hormone doc from Austin, Natalie Crawford, so OB-GYN. Vaping is associated with disruptions in egg health and what they call egg quality can create certain mutations in eggs and serious endocrine issues in women. Personally, I find it disgusting, like I just find it, like I don't do it, but when I see people vaping, to me, and listen, I used to, when growing up, I quit smoking a long time ago, but I used to smoke a bit of nicotine growing up. Remember, I was a wild one, but that's not why I did it. I just, nicotine works for me as a drug and I don't do it anymore. Vaping is so addictive. It's a mutagen. It mutates the genes of cells. It mutates the genes of rapidly dividing cells most, so breast cancers, ovarian cancers, egg quality, sperm are constantly turning over. People always say, oh, well, I vape all the time and I got so-and-so pregnant or whatever. When I say, I have a perfectly healthy kid, that kid might have been much healthier. Also, the kid's not grown up yet, like introducing me the kid later. I wish for that kid. I pray for them, but that their healthy is can be. But it is so clear that you're introducing a laundry list of toxins to the lungs and they're getting into the bloodstream and there are a number of them that cross the blood brain barrier. Once they cross the blood brain barrier, those neurons, by virtue of the fact that neurons don't turn over across the lifespan, you've born with the ones you're going to die with. You might add a few across your lifespan, but you're mostly born with the ones that you're going to die with. Well, they're going to harbor those chemicals and those particulates. Yes, we have a grandparents that smoked and lived to be 90, but those are generally the outliers. I can't find one good reason why people should vape. If people want nicotine in their system that badly and here I'm not recommending that, they would be much better off relying on a troture of patch or even toothpicks or injectable. I know people I'm not going to out any nicotine. Oh, I'm not going to out anyone here, but I know people in our podcast community that rely on nicotine injections for a tormental clarity. That is so hardcore. Yeah, I don't. It causes elevation and blood pressure. It causes these with constriction, but it also will robustly increase focus and attention. That is what we'll tell you.","Poster, Microphone, Watch, Laptop, Bottle, Human face, Clothing, Table, Man, Person Pu, RDY, 4, ERN | WISDOM, A, 7, BDY"", ncA, HAZAR@tzardboysmedia2, d TikTok, R, MIW, De, |, HAZARCHAZAR, HAZA, OOCAS, BOYSDYS, N, c TikTok, Pd, YS, HAZARD@hazardboysmedia2, an, r, T, onch, ancA, HAZARO, YOUR BABY!, MW, :, nch, SAzARD, Po, MAzARerazardboyamedb2, C TikTok, y, HAZABOHAZARD, d TikTOk, DYS, ERN WISDOM, Y, HAZAR, @hazardboysmedia2, anCA, TikTok, BDYS, MEDIA, AZARD, B, -AZAI, HAZAR@hazardboysmedia2, BOYBOYS, AZARO, BOY, 3O, Vaping will, ODCAS, (, >, M|W, HAZARI, mAzARDerazardboysmedia2, BOYSOYS, o TikTok, Do, RHY, P, BOYS, t, a, -, anch, HAZAROHAZARD, 10, canch, BOYBDYS, PODCAS, cnch, HAZARD, HAzAR@hazardboysmedia2, OYS, ., C, I, ERN |WISDOM, PO, HAZARDNAZARD, HAzAEetazardboysmedia2, 17, cnc, MUTATE, HAZARCHAZARD, tY, HAZARehazardboysmedia, d, DY, BOYSES, 1, anc, RY"

7330323324083375403,," My name is Marissa and I have vaped for about 10 years. Monday morning I woke up. Um, well now I got home from the airport at like five of my vaped died and I decided I'm not gonna buy anymore. Um, I've literally vaped since I was 14, almost 23. Um, I got my first nicotine device when I was a sophomore in high school. Got a jewel. I mean my best friend Holly shout out Holly. Um, walked into a gas station and tried to buy one and they did not sell it to us because we looked like literal baby girls. So we asked, I don't even know some older boy. I think one of her brother's friends or her brother to buy us one and he did. So thanks whoever you were for creating a very disgusting addiction. Um, but yeah, I've tried to quit multiple times. I've quit a few times for like between like six months to a year. Each time I always end up coming back to it unfortunately, but yeah, I'm gonna try and do things a little different this time. Um, yeah, so I'm just gonna kind of share my process with nicotine. I can't like update you guys on my process with quitting if you want. Um, but yeah, I'm just, I don't know, I've never made a talking video on just doing this because it's honestly like a really hard process. I've like I said failed multiple times. So, um, if this helps anybody or maybe it'll help me, hold me accountable. So yeah, here we go. So every time I've quit before, I have used nicotine gum, um, which honestly, like, um, I think the nicotine gum works. It doesn't, but I feel like it didn't like hold me super accountable to like not beyond nicotine. Because like, I feel like for smoking, it's more helpful because you're eliminating those harsh chemicals without like cold turkey in your body from nicotine, which is obviously the addictive substance. Um, whereas with vaping, it's, I feel like mostly nicotine. Obviously, there's other like vapors, like I think there's for melduhutter or something. And like not good stuff, but, um, I don't know, like people use vaping to quit smoking. So I feel like it kind of eliminates, I don't know. But yeah, every time I've quit before, I have worked in the restaurant industry where if you know, you know, everyone goes on breaks and hits their bakes or smokes or whatever. Um, and I've always like gone out with some friends, like on my break, friends I work with co-workers and like, oh my gosh, can I hit your babe? Like let me hear babe. And then I'll feel bad. I'm doing it all the time and I'll be like, I'll just buy my own, like I'll only use it at work. And then, full blown addicted again. So I still work in a restaurant. Um, I graduate school in about six and a half months. So hopefully we're done then and maybe it'll be easier. But yeah, point is like, I don't have always been excuses for quitting. Like I've always just been like, yeah, I'll quit when I'm done with school. I'll quit when I'm done in the restaurant industry. I'll quit when I'm less stressed. But the thing is, you're always going to be stressed. You're always going to be stressed. So if you're making excuses like that, stop making excuses. If you want to be done, be done. But yeah, I don't know why I like literally have it on me at all times. Like wake up in the morning, need it. I don't know, it's just really bad and it's like, it definitely like takes up my life. I'm definitely dependent on it. I wake up, I want it. I eat a meal, I want it. I am driving in the car, I want it, I'm working, I want it. I'm in my clinicals in school and every time I finish a patient. Yeah, some one day I like I said I think I got home from the airport and it was dead and I just started to cold turkey yet. Today's Wednesday, technically like day three, going into without any nicotine whatsoever. I'm not using nicotine this time. I'm just like fully cutting it out. No nicotine in my system. Honestly, I don't feel too terrible. I don't know. I like was a little cranky probably yesterday, but it's really not that bad. I've been definitely like snacky, which I'm not usually. I feel like I woke up, I had my coffee and that kind of was like a trigger. The coffee. But yeah, other than that, so far so good. I've definitely been craving it like this morning. I woke up and like, I usually like keep it in my pocket if I have like a big hoodie on in the morning and I like walk around. I like feel it all the time. I was kind of feeling my pocket like wanting it. But yeah, my story is with quitting. I guess I can talk about the first time I quit. I was dabbling with some ADHD medications and they put me on a little bit trend to start. If you don't know that is a smoking cessation aid. So and that like just totally effed me up. So like I blacked out an entire week when I was on that, but I quit vaping. So I got off that very, very quick as soon as I could and was over the babe. And then yeah, started working at a restaurant got back on it. And then I think I tried nicotine gum. I've quit like three times since then. I've used nicotine gum. But I've like never not been fully off nicotine. Like every time I've quit, I've been chewing nicotine gum like daily. So this time is for real. If you want I can talk about how I'm feeling throughout the process or I can just shut the bug out if you guys want to. But yeah, good luck to all y'all out there with me.",

7206210728120864001,Annie donovan original baby video. Baby given vape. I’m a proud teen mum but we’re not the same period. Ill catch a case for my kids! 😤#anniedonovan #chrissycutts #australia  #jailwifelife #jailwife #prisonwife #prisontok #youngmum #teenmum ," There's a video going viral at the moment on TikTok of a young mom who gave her 11-month-old evape and she's getting direct for the mod and I'm not going to add to that because TikTok has done a very fine job of that. I wonder how ever speak about and give perspective on what I feel and think about the adults and the people that she surrounds the self-worth. I'm hopeful that you will learn from this because it concerns me that you were so comfortable in posting this film. This video and that to me indicates that the adults in the room have failed you as well, have failed you in a way where they should have pulled you up and said actually that is not okay. TikTok shouldn't have had to tell you that the local news, it going viral should not have had to tell you that that's not okay because that is not okay. Let me tell you, I've got a seven-month-old child and if I gave my daughter a evape, I guarantee you I'd be waking up in the ICU. From just the people that I surround myself with, who know my children, I would not be making a video, that's for sure. I will be waking up wondering what the hell just happened because my family would not let that slide period. I just feel like I'm not deferring the blame to the ones in the room. I believe that everyone that's accountable to that video is accountable. Not only this young mom, but the people within the video or whoever allowed for this to happen because she, this young mom should not have been that comfortable in creating the video in the first place. I jumped on this because I was a teen mom at 17 and I'm a part of a group where there's 20,000 plus young moms here in Australia where we support each other and love the crap out of our children. And let me tell you, these young moms are absolutely amazing. We are not a part of the minority that create the stigma that we're unable to raise children that were babies raising babies. There are so many of them.","Poster, Fashion accessory, Necklace, Human face, Woman, Clothing, Girl, Person , THIS TO HAPPEN., AND LET ME TELL, G, PLUS YOUNG MUMS, tx, @chrissycutts, VAPE., A VAPE I GUARANTEE, THE PEOPLE THAT, IWANT TO HOWEVER, RAISING BABIES, CTikTOk, A, IN POSTING THIS, HERE IN AUSTRALIA, CAUSE TIKTOK, BLAME TO THE, OF A GROUP WHERE, BECAUSE IT CONGERNS, E, GOING VIRAL, YOU THAT., AMAZING, WOULD NOT LET, WILL, HAVE HAD TO, HAVE FAILED, d TikTok, L>, DEFERRING THE, AND SHE'S GETTING, PERIOD., MY CHILDREN., PEOPLE THAT, THAT ARE DOING, YOU UP AND SAID, AND GIVE PERSPECTIVE, ONES IN THE, JUST HAPPENI, IS ACCOUNTABLE, T, THAT'S FOR SURE., D, a head, UP IN THE ICU., AND I JUST FEEL, TIKTOK SHOULDM'T, SHOULD BE HELD, YOUNG MUM, MAKING A VIDEG, JUMPED ON, 2, THAT THE ADULTS, IT GOING VIRAL, THE FIRST PLACE., Tik Tok, me I've got, OR WHOEVER, if, WHERE THEY SHOULD, ALLOWED FOR, 00, I WANT TO HOWEVER, LEARN FROM THIS, YEAH I WOULD, ON WHAT RFEEL, IN THE ROOM, MANY YOUNG MUMS, THE STIGMA THAT, J TIKTOK, O TiKTOk, DRAGGED THROUGH, I SURROUND MYSELF, YOU AS WELL., SHOULD NOT HAVE, YOU,, JUST HAPPENED, I'M NOT GOING, A YOUNG MUM, 11 MONTH, HERSELF WITH., TikTok, ABLE, AND I'M A PART, THESE YOUNG, WAKING UP WONDERING, AT THE MOMENT, THIS YOUNG MUM, THAT IS NOT, RYONE THAT'S, WHO GAVE HER, YOU I'VE GOT, A VAPE IGDARATEE, I'M HOPEFUL, BECAUSE TITOK, THAT CREATE, & articulate, O TikTok, NOT BE, TO THATVIDEO, THERE'S A VIDEO, ON WHAT IFEEL, YOU I'D BE WAKING, MUMS ARE ABSOLUTELY, >, bare with, I WOULD BE, EVERYONE THAT'S, YOU IN A WAY, It cut out...., THERE'S 20,000, BECAUSE TIKTOK, It cut out., NOT ONLY THIS, t**, WE ARE NOTA, o TikTok, If, ME INDICATES, THE STIGMATHAT, P, BEEN THAT, EACH OTHER AND, t, a, CHILD AND IF, A 7 MONTHOLD, 3, -, +, ROOM., SELIEVE TI, SHE SURROUNDS, **, EEGH OTHRAND, *, THE LOCAL NEWS,, It cut out..., dTikTok, It cut out.., NOTOKAY BECAUSE, WITHIN THE VIDEO, OUT OF OUR CHILDREN., IN CREATING, THAT WE RE BABIES, COMFO, SHE,, i, 11 month old given a vape, I, TO THAT VIDEO, J, O, OKAY., WITH WHO KNOW, LIKE I'M NOT, AND, my thoughts., BUT THE PEOPLE, TO ADD TO THAT, THAT SLIDE., S, THE ADULTS AND, YOU WERE SO, NOT OKAY BECAUSE, THINKABOUT, AND THAT TO, PART OF THE, WHERE WE, FROM JUST THE, MUM AT 17, LOVE THE CRAP, C TIKTOK, IS NOT OKAY., TO RAISE CHILDREN,, >>, 1, I WAS A TEEN, GAVE MY DAUGHTER, MINORITY, BECAUSE MY FAMILY, GAVE MYDUGHTE, L, HAS DONE AVERY, cold as I try, THE MUD AND"

I know that they say like don't take super hot baths. So I don't take hot baths but I do take warm baths. Um, because I helped my muscles relax. And I have been using a melatonin body scrub because you can't take melatonin while you're pregnant. Um, but you can apply it topically. And yeah, don't like overdo it of course. But um, oh, also I use good molecules and this is the... Naya Sinamine, brightening toner. And this is the ultra hydrating facial oil.

She's a team mom or she's like early 20s or whatnot You can hear her In the background saying oh you want to hit you want to hit as she's vaping in front of her Ten-month-old son and she proceeds to put the vape sorry to put the vape To this little boy's mouth and he sucks on it because a lot of toddlers everyone else is like they have pacifiers and things to fucking suck on and Teeth and whatnot and he puts it in his mouth While she's holding it and he braids in and braids out and then they start laughing Like he's ten months old Like what the fuck and you proceed to go and you post it on social media Like there's just so many things wrong with this like why would you even do that in the first place? But then why would you laugh about it and then post it? Like at this point I would not be surprised if That child is taken out of the mom's custody and I honestly I kind of hope that it is Because that's just really fucked up in my opinion Like I honestly have no words Like that poor baby and He's been going to the hospital in and out and getting check-ups because of that one little puff that you forced into your sense of mouth I want the fuck and then I'm also gonna put what she posted on Facebook Here so then just pause to read hold on That's like anyway pause to read that What do you guys think do you guys think that this child this time on the told baby boy should be taken out of custody? Or do you think that they should leave them there because who the fuck knows what else they're doing to this poor kid Like I'm actually so upset right now and I don't even know this person like they're across world for me I don't know",

It’s always a good idea to double check something so shocking that it can’t be true, like toy vapes.  #medialiteracy #babyvapes #satire #vape "," I've seen a lot of weird things on TikTok, but none have been as weird as baby vapes. That's right, this TikTok, which is currently at 50 million views and 7 million likes, claims to show a product called my first vape. The product supposedly teaches, and I quote, how to make sick clouds for babies. So let's check out if this is real or not. There's two ways you could fact check this claim, either a reverse image search or a keyword search. Since this post was a slideshow, I was able to just hold down on this last slide and download it. Now I'm going to be honest, Google images is a little hard to use on the phone, so if you were really adamant about using this tool, I suggest you send it to your computer so you can easily use that search engine. When I use that search engine, I was sent to Amazon links of empty boxes that are intended to be pranks, and the My First Vape is included in one of those. I also saw posts from users who were joking about giving it to kids, and I saw posts from concerned users who believed it. You could also do a keyword search of My First Vape, and when I did that, a writer's article came up immediately. It confirmed that this is not a real product and that it's intended to be satire. In fact, it says that this is a reoccurring meme or something we like to call a zombie claim, and is intended to be funny. Thought whether this TikToker was fooled by the image or intended to shock viewers to get more interaction, it's always a good idea to double check your information, especially if something seems really weird, like baby toy vapes.",

7318404733889301803,Part 2 #usa🇺🇸 #fyp #reddit #viral ," When he took mushrooms on the drive over which kicked him while he was there, and even though it was a small dose as he recalls it, it hit him way harder than expected. My uncle proceeded to kind of flip out and took a two hour long bath in our house to calm down. The only problem was, he accidentally turned the tap on his way out of the bath and flooded the bathroom. He did end up paying for the damages however. It took half a year for my father to concede to him being allowed in the house again. So, my uncle was over, and things were going good. We were all having. Dinner as a family, talking about the baby, my uncle was talking about how space aliens contacted him in his dream, typical stuff. The baby was asleep in the cot in the living room, and there was no sense of any danger. My uncle was perfectly understanding of the fact that he could not hold the baby. Well, my uncle excused himself to go to the bathroom, and off he went. On his way back to the kitchen, he stopped by the cot to look at the baby. This caught my father's attention, and before any of us could do anything. My uncle took his vape from his pocket, took a drag which lasted about 10 seconds, and proceeded to rip a huge cloud right in the baby's face. This caused the baby to wake up and start crying. I stood up, my mother rushed over to pick up the baby, but my dad stayed seated. My uncle laughed, saying he has inaugurated the baby into the family, and this sentence was all it took for my dad. My dad left from his chair and ran at my uncle, pushing him to the ground, proceeding to sock him in the face over and over again. I stood in shock, I had never seen my dad violent before. It felt like my dad wailed on him for hours, when in reality it was like 15 seconds before he stopped dude my mother screaming and begging him to stop while trying to drag him away. Although my dad only spent 15 or so seconds wailing on my uncle, he broke his nose and fractured some ribs, as well as cracked his jaw. The baby was crying, the ambulance was called by my mother, my uncle reported my father from the hospital which led to my dad being arrested but then bailed out by my mother. My uncle is now pressing charges for assault.","Fashion accessory, Surfboard, Clothing, Human hand, Man, Footwear, Person JAW, all, DUE, HOWEVER, ctikTok, GOOD, 40>, o Tikto, EXCUSED, AWAY, 4, ****, 8, OTikioR, SECONDS, TRYING, OMAIDID, GROUND, .OLEOT .OEN LOO, HOURS, MY, TALKING, d Tiok, TOOK, 000, d TikTok, AS, TO, PICA, THIS, C TiKTO, CLOUD, - sre, c TikTok, @kkk12386, BATHROOM, ON, THAT, REALITY, TikTOk, 10>, WELL, COWNO 30 S4, 2, MOTHER, at 8r, STIKTO, ANY, ALL, START, OVER, Tik Tok, SAE, :, DOSE, UNCLE, 3304, C TikTok, SOME, SHOCK, BABY, C TikTOk, TikTok, o TikTOk, HIS, PAYING, ar, NkTok, DINNER, ED, ATHER'S, BATHROO!, O TikTok, Tiklok, WENT, ep, HOSPITAL, C TiKTOK, 40, HIG:AVT, 6, THE, OUR, '@kkk12386, . ., o TikTok, IT, SO, AMBULANCE, P, a, @kkk123, orst arBr-AS E, -, 3, DOWN, ALIENS, CHAIR, NG, THAN, SEATED, INTO, ASSAULT, UNDERSTANDI, CAR, TiKTOR, WAY, C, ACCIDENTALLY, I, @klk2386, AGAIN, TiKTOK, O, CTiKTOR, AND, ALLOWED, IS 10, FACE, 2+3510, ikTok, 23A, C TikTOR, OUT, dnor, .OEO .OE ., TikTo, TWO, 0, PICK, CRYING, DEQUEE2, CTikTok, LAUGHED, 0 10b, PROBLEM, FAMILY, 10"

7244276378059738414,Replying to @Nat Shea ✨   shmokin Shmeed While Breastfeeding #breastfeeding #breastfeedingtok #🍃 #shmeed ," So on my last video, we talked about breastfeeding and if it's good or bad, and kinda how all those studies played out. And there were a couple questions that I wanted to answer. Question that I wanted to address is will it affect my milk splice? Something that every breastfeeding and pumping mom worry about. Let's dig into it. To start us off, if you didn't see my last video, hi, my name is Sam. I am not a medical professional. I am just a mama with a bunch of research behind her hands. What I say take lightly, make sure you're talking to your physician, make sure you're working in regards to all of that, but this is just the studies that I've seen. So there's two things that mainly or not, mainly that really work together to produce your milk supply to hormones. Oxytocin and prolactin. Oxytocin's probably the most known hormone. It's love hormone, right? It's that lovey, w-feeling that you feel when you're hugging your newborn baby, when you're with your husband or wife or non-binary spouse. Oh, you know what I mean? It's that love hormone. And prolactin is created by the pituitary gland. The two really kind of come into play when it comes to breastfeeding, but as I said in my last video, there's not many studies going, oh, well, it's breastfeeding, going to increase it or decrease it because it's not really, I don't want to say humane, but not a lot of scientists are going to be like, here, go smoke this. And we'll see what happens to your baby. It's just, they don't do it like that. But there are a lot of studies when it comes to a schmokinshmeed and your oxytocin levels and your prolactin levels. Mainly because they wanted to study the pituitary gland, not necessarily breastfeeding. One thing that I'll say is if you're looking for any of these studies or if you wanted to research any of these studies, always look at a website that's.edu.gov.org because those are all regulated sites. So when it comes to the study of schmied and your oxytocin levels, it is actually increased when you do schmokschmeed. Same thing with prolactin, it's actually been studied that it increases prolactin levels as well. So those two hormones can increase. However, you're asking will it affect your mokes apply? Everybody's hormones are different, right? So like, for example, I have PCOS. My hormones are already done. So where my oxytocin might increase up to a certain amount, maybe my prolactin doesn't. Or maybe one is like completely out of the roof. And one is almost there, but all my other hormones are like, hold up, level it down. So it's all going to actually depend on that specific person and how their hormone levels will play out when they schmokschmeed. Which is hard, you can't really tell that, right? So I do this a lot when I answer questions and I tend to never give actual full on answers. So I'll get to the point. There's a couple of things that you can watch since you won't really know what your hormone levels are going to do. One, always watch your water intake. Make sure you are drinking your body weight in water. That may not be an accurate description, but you need to make sure you're drinking a lot of water. And we know that schmokschmeed makes us dehydrated bitches. So smoke your water, munch on popsicles, make sure you're getting, does it smoke your water? Oh, well, you get the point. Drink your water. That's going to be the number one thing. Drink, drink, drink. We all know that schmokschmeed makes us hungry. But are you snacking on the right shit? Because it doesn't always make you hungry for the things that your actual body needs. So if you get the munchies, make sure you're munching on things, high protein. Make sure you're getting all your food groups. Make sure everything's leveled out. That's going to be a really big one because not a lot of women actually eat their calories that they need to eat. You need to be eating at least 2,000 calories while you're breastfeeding. If you're a pumping mom or a part-time pumping mom, you got to remember to pump. Honestly, I'm already a forgetful bitch. So make sure you set a timer. Make sure you're pumping your normal three to four hour block, two to three hour block. Make sure you're doing your power pumps. If you need a power pump, that's going to be a big one. Make sure you remember to do that. Make sure your milk is already regulated. This generally happens between the six to 12 week of breastfeeding. Make sure you're getting a regular milk supply. And then at that point, you just really got to watch it. If you notice a dramatic dip, honestly, quit. Not breastfeeding, quit. This is just mokatch me. It's not worth it. And honestly, as long as you can make it as far as you can make it with your baby, that's going to be the number one thing that needs to come into play. So I hope that helped. Let me know if you have any other questions more than happy to.",

So the answer is yes, smokers can breastfeed. I first want to start off by saying, I think that smoking is terrible, and I really don't recommend that anyone smoke, but I also recognize that it's an addiction and people do smoke while they're pregnant and while they're breastfeeding. So if you're unable to quit, please know that you can breastfeed your baby and I encourage you to breastfeed your baby. I'll tell you why it's a great idea to continue breastfeeding if you are a smoker, is that infants that are in homes with smokers have an increased risk of scissor and infant death syndrome. But by breastfeeding, you actually will decrease this risk for the infant. Other things to note, if you are a smoker and breastfeeding, you may have a decreased milk production because smoking will decrease the blood flow to the breast tissue. You also may be slightly decreasing out of fat in the breast milk, but I wouldn't worry too much about that. You wanna try to smoke after you feed, not before feeding, just to reduce the exposure of the smoke being on your clothing and et cetera. And if you're willing to try to quit, highly recommend a nicotine replacement. That's would be those patches or gums, things like that are safe for breastfeeding. Hope this was helpful.",

If you're smoking a pack a day, it really can decrease your supply. So you want to cut back a little bit if you can. Now because nicotine kind of sticks to our skin, your best bet would be to breastfeed the baby before you smoke. Go outside, put on like a smoking jacket, a flannel shirt, something like that. Smoke the cigarette, leave the jacket outside, come back in, any of the skin that was exposed to the nicotine, you're going to wash with soap and water before you hold the baby again. We all have coping mechanisms that we've developed to deal with our stress or other things in life. So maybe you can replace some of those smoking sessions with a hobby, maybe read a book, maybe take a walk, find something that you can do that's going to be more beneficial for you and might not interfere with breastfeeding during this time.",

I have not been using the benefits of my medical card because they've been a little bit iffy. But this came up. Let's talk about it. So I did know this little fact right here. It can stay in your breast milk for up to six days. This was the most mind blowing fact that I read in the entire article. Almost 1% can end up in breast milk. Are we really concerned with 1%? I didn't know this one. It can slow your milk production. These two facts here came from surveys that were filled out by parents who said that they had exposure to the active ingredient. It could alter the brain in subtle ways, whatever that means, and that the kids were more easily fatigued and had poor sucking skills. This was a few dinnabress feed. They're worried about secondhand smoke. But what if it's an edible? There's no smoke.

Stay strong, mama, and steer clear of anything that could harm your precious bundle of joy.  2️⃣ BYE-BYE to unhealthy foods  Your body is now a sanctuary for your baby's growth, so fuel it with wholesome goodness.  Avoid processed junk food, excessive caffeine, and raw or undercooked foods.

Studies have shown that smoking can damage the eggs within the arteries. Know that you are born with all the eggs you would ever have. So if they are lost or they are damaged, they cannot be regenerated. Smoking can also speed up the rate of loss of these eggs and also cause them to age prematurely. This can make it difficult to get pregnant and potentially leads to early menopause. So if you're crazy hoping to start a family someday, all struggle with fertility and you smoke, it is best to stop smoking now.",

But before that, I should state that shaming mothers has no role here. Coding marijuana after developing a dependence or addiction is no easy feat, and it's only made harder when mothers are made to feel the profound loneliness of shame. I think that shame ranks among the few truly senseless emotions, because it means rejecting someone for not being their best self, while seemingly denying that they could be, if only given the proper help. How could we possibly be working towards the good while less signing another person the fate of being bad? So no, although using marijuana in pregnancy has risks, it doesn't mean that you're a bad mother overall, or that you don't adore your kid. As I responded in some of the comments, this effect only exists on a population level, meaning that it won't be present or obvious in every case. As a third-year medical student, I once watched a maternal fetal medicine specialist explain to a young mother that her second term pregnancy was no longer viable due to a rare birth defect called syrinomilia. This is when the legs fuse together, not leaving room for the formation of critical organs like the outflow tracks. After a long pause, the doctor asked the mother if she felt responsible in some way, and she managed to gesture through her tears that yes, she felt that fault. I couldn't understand why that would be at first, which is why I'll never forget what the doctor said next. Paraphrasing, people can't stand something tragic happening for no reason at all, so often they invent one, and worst of all, they turn on themselves. Some others watching these videos turn instead for help. You tell the doctor that you're wanting the quit substance during pregnancy, then assuming that you have a minimally decent one, the response won't be judgment. It will be a pause and practical use for advice.",

I see we're smoking. We're not smoking, we're vaping. What's the difference? Smoking is for losers. Vaping is for douchebags. Oh, I want to be a douchebag. Do you own 19 hats? I only have one, but it's a stucy hat with a flat rim. Have a seat. Oh, it's delightful. Oh, my God. Where there's smoke, there's just me vaping. Stewie, if mom and dad see you with that thing, no kill me, get rid of it. Oh, wait, it's awesome. Watch this. I'm not good at the football part. Yummy. Watch this. Like the movie The Ring. Awesome. Come back here, you. Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it. EWICWID, please. Anything that tastes like a fruit roll-up. Good, all good. All good. No worries. All good? Good, all good. Here you go. You good? You're good? All good here? Yep, we're good. Good, all good. This whole vaping thing was a very smart move. It tastes great, and I don't feel violently ill as long as some of this vapor is in my lungs. Plus, when you wake up at night shaking because you haven't had any in three hours, it's so easy to vape more. Hi, honey. Mommy needs money for scratches. What the... What kind of brazen fever is this? What you get this? Criss-griffin, you get in here. What is this? Um, robot penis? Seriously, I'm absolutely jonesing right now, so give it back. I know what this is. I'm not doing it. You are too young to be able to do it. Maybe it is, and he's just too young to hold up. But still we didn't get his hands out. I don't know, mom. I'm not my brother's keeper. It's a baby. Well, baby, they're stupid like that. I'm good. You walk round, mister. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Oh, it tastes so good. Like skin berries. What am I alive with pleasure? Yeah! It's possible we've taken this too far. I'll just go down and get yours back. Mom, I need to talk to you. Technically, that was not my vape pen, but I do need it back because it belongs to a friend of mine. We accidentally switched jackets, not unlike that episode of the Brady Bunch when you break. Oh, damn it, Criss. Why do your lies have to take so damn long? You're smoking the vape pen? No, I'm sneaking a real cigarette, like frustrated mothers are supposed to do. You're such a hypocrite. At least vapin is healthy. Oh, don't be an idiot. vapin is just as bad and you look like a douchebag. No, I don't. I look cool. Go ahead. Hold it to your mouth. Oh my god. I am a douchebag. It's okay, Criss. Your secret's safe with me. Hmm?",
7275670345502281003,Vape Addicts Be Like… #lonee #animatedstory #vapingkillsyou ," Okay, so throughout my high school experience, I have seen and observed the abundance of kids who babe And I'm certain you guys in high school still have as well Like these kids be hitting their vape pens, like it's their nine and five job, like Like god damn chill a little bit Well based on my observations throughout the years, I think I'm well enough qualified to speak on the different types of kids who babe So let's get into it Okay, first we got the washroom vapors Okay, so imagine this, you're in class and you raise your hand to go to the washroom The teacher then grants you permission and you head on down through the hallways and make it to the washroom So you open the door and boom There's like six dudes all showing in the washroom taking up as much space like they're the gatekeepers While they're smacking their vapes creating a thick fog in the entire washroom Like bro, I'm just trying to take a dump or a little tinkle And there's cherry-smell and fog that just came out of your German chest and mouth walking my vision Like what if I missed the urinal or toilet because of your vape clouds visually impairing me It would be your fault and therefore your mesochemino. Don't be like these guys Next we have the kids who vape during class This is the kid who can't go a whole period without hitting their pen And they try to hide the smoke by bogging it into their sweater Or out in open window when the teacher isn't looking But then sometimes the kid gets caught and caught out by the teacher and it usually ends up like this Are you vaping in my class Jordan? Uh no, why would I do that? It's like really bad for you know that miss? Go to the office now Jordan, come on miss. I now okay fine Next up we have the beggar. This kid will beg and bother other people who have vapes for a hit And they are literally allergic to buying their own device They're like comparable to a parasite just leaching other people's ejuice for themselves Yo is that a vape? Yeah, can I get a hit bro? Yeah sure go ahead Yo how's it bro? Yo can I get another one? Uh, I mean sure Bro last one I swear fine last one Yo bro, please bro I'm begging what last one man please bro, please Next we have the kiduka do tricks So this kid has been vaping for a good amount of time and saw people doing some tricks with their vape on the internet And thought it was the coolest thing ever and began watching YouTube tutorials on how to blow o's vape trick All of them all these kids are pretty chill and I'm not gonna lie the tricks These people do vape clouds are pretty cool Well, you can't lie they're pretty cool next up. We got the pro vapor This guy has completely given up on getting rid of their addiction and moved on from your average disposable vapes He's using some next level upgraded vapes that look like cards that should be found in a robot One hit from one of these will have you turning into a transformer ready to fight some decepticons Auto watch roll out Next we have the I'm not addicted kid This kid will use any remaining lunch money given from his parents just to buy more carts And will argue with you on how they aren't addicted When they clearly are and they just don't want to admit it These types of people will argue like their life depends on it Yo dude are you vaping bro? Yeah bro I thought you quit Yeah bro after this car runs out I'm done for good Trust me Yeah right bro you said that like three other times you're definitely addicted And I'm not bro I can quit like anytime I want to You think I'm gonna let this chemical dictate what I do? No man Okay whatever you say Two days later Oh man it's how to juice One mango cart please Bye if you don't And finally we have the classic kid who loses their vape This kid is so addicted to his vape that he's built like a reliance to it My bro needs it or else he will die and explode into a thousand pieces But when he loses it he starts freaking out like he's the joker Like where's it where's it where's it where's it Like he just lost his newborn baby looking like gallum from the hobbit He starts looking everywhere in his room and starts moving stuff everywhere Creating a whole mess Like usually they find it in the most obvious locations in the end too Like in the pocket of their jacket Like nice one man you just made a whole mess in your room that you have to clean up now When it was in the most obvious place to check Okay bye","Land vehicle, Book, Headphones, Pillow, Table, Hat, Food, Man, Person, Car, Poster, Lamp, Power plugs and sockets, Bottle, Boat, Clothing, Computer Keyboard, Building, Taxi, Helmet, Toy, Tie, Bed, Mouse, Human face, Convenience store, Shelf, Clock, Traffic sign, Laptop, Desk, Curtain, Wheel, Computer monitor, Chair, Airplane, Glasses, Picture frame, Apple , THEIR PEN,, How to Blow O's Vape Tricks, ENDS UP LIKE THIS., 4, ENTIRE WASHROOM., CKTOK, TTok, OF THEIR ADDICTION, AYVIGION, THAT HE'S BUILT, COULD DO TRICKS., HLnOW, 3.49M subscribers, THAT JUST CAME OUT., ANDIM CERTAIN, VapeChilla, d TiKTOk, WHOLE MESS., YOUR HAND, M NOT ADDICTED KI, NEETOK, c TikTok, ON, sneetok, LIKE A RELIANCE TO, T@LONEETOK, TO A PARASITE, ik, IVESEEN, AM NOT, You guys waited a long time for this video, WELL, 2, Qlonceiok, LIKE ITS LIKE GOD, @LOKE, Tik Tok, OWN DEVICE., TKO, ARE PRETTY COOL., C TikTok, NEFTON, @loneciok, (LONEETOK, AND EXPLODE, COME ON, @LNEETOK, THE PRO, YOU TURNING, GLofrok, WE HAVE THE BEGGAR., TO TAKE A DUMP, REALLY BAD FOR YOU., IMAGINE THIS., BY COING INTO, BRO PLEASE., TRICK OVER., LIKE ANY TIME, @LONEETOK, AUTO BOTS, @LOEETOK, WHAT IFIMISS, STILL HAVE AS WELL,, ROLLOUT, TRICKS KID, https://www.twitch.tv/vapechilla IG: @VapeChillaOFFICIAL ..., O TikTok, NICE ONE, BOY, YEAH, LAST ONE., >, moncetok, AND FINALLY,, AFTER THIS CAR, WHEN THEY CLEARLY A, P, ONE MANGO, ikTO, OPERATIVE AIDS, THERE'S LIKE,, AT AMOUNT OF, 5.3M views5 years ago, @lonsctok, CTiKTok, LATER.., so here you go!

Vaping is terrible because of the other chemicals that deliver to the lungs. Vaping is associated with disruptions in egg health and what they call egg quality can create certain mutations in eggs and serious endocrine issues in women. Vaping is so addictive. It's a mutagen. It mutates the genes of cells. It mutates the genes of rapidly dividing cells most. So breast cancers, ovarian cancers, egg quality, sperm are constantly turning over. People always say, oh, I vape all the time and I got so-and-so pregnant or whatever. You know, women will say, I have a perfectly healthy kid. That kid might have been much healthier and also the kid's not grown up yet. Like introducing me to the kid later. I wish for that kid. I pray for them that their healthy is can be. It is so clear that you're introducing a laundry list of toxins to the lungs and they're getting into the bloodstream and there are a number of them that cross the blood brain barrier. And once they cross the blood brain barrier, those neurons by virtue of the fact that neurons don't turn over across the lifespan, you've born with the ones you're going to die with. You might add a few across your lifespan but you're mostly born with the ones that you're going to die with. Well, they're going to harbor those chemicals and those particulates.

Episode 60 of my podcast goes into this in detail if one minute is not enough for you. So if you smoke or use tobacco products or use nicotine, you are still encouraged to breastfeed. However, we're going to encourage you to reduce your use because you can pass some of that through your milk to your baby. But this is not a reason to tell somebody not to feed their baby their milk. Basically, the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh the risks. The thing that I am most serious about with my own clients is second and third-hand smoke exposure to baby. So of course, we're not going to smoke or vape around baby. But we're also going to wash our hands and change our clothes before we touch baby after we're using those products. And we're certainly not going to bedshare if we're smoking. So smoke free house, smoke free car, smoke free clothes, smoke free skin.","Human face, Woman, Clothing S, d TikTok, I, @milk_minute_podcast, TikTok, d, J, What about nicotine?, P, Reply to jackielary's comment"

Hey. I have like, legit anxiety. Why? I have a vibe. Okay, I'm feeling it. The John wants to say something to me. He wants to see him. He's wanting to come at me. He's wanting to come at me, Kristian. Tell me, I would not feel this way. I would not feel this way. And I had this much anxiety if there was not some trigger creating it like, I don't want to fight. I don't know. I'm not fighting with anybody. So. Okay. Okay. That's fine. I mean, just go. I want you to come in there. I want to go with us. Give John a chance. I'm not gonna ask you why. I'm sensitive to energy. And I don't want his vibes in my chicken. Just want to take me. Okay, stop. Just stop. He's like a one of attack you. Relax. Relax. I want to see him relax. I do. God. Just be nice. Hey. What's up? There's something that doesn't feel right. My vibes, my tickers, my all of it's flying. But there's no way I can even explain this to John because my sister doesn't want him to know about our psychic abilities. Because she's afraid to lose him. She's afraid he'll judge her. Or not see her the same. Oh my God, my little image is not. I'm not this perfect cookie cutter person. I'm not a separate wife. I just want, I want this things to go good. You know what I mean? Like I don't want, she says I mean you, John, all the time. Oh. Literally. Yeah. But you say I mean you. No. I said you don't like me. I never said that. I do like you. Well, you need to know how close we are, John. You don't even know. She's like, she don't know how close we are. Okay. And I don't want you to not like me because of... I've never said I didn't like you. Okay. So I guess I'm crazy. I guess I'm crazy because I feel shit. So you did I say that though? I have anxiety right now because I know John. Something bothers you right now about me. It bothers me that you don't like me. John, you clear it me. See, oh, there we go. I don't have the time of the day to glare at somebody. I don't glare at people I don't like. I just tell them I don't like them. I absolutely did not glare at her. It's amazing that she came up with that out of nowhere. So right now I'm saying, let's fix it. Let's fix it. We don't need to do that. Let's fix it. Okay. How about we all say, you know what? I accept you. I accept you. I accept you. And we all be ourselves. And we all tell each other everything about who the fuck we are. Let's own it. Let's be honest. Because if I could be myself, then she could be herself. And we could all be ourselves. We've been ourselves. You don't tell John your psychic powers. That's where you change. I think that you hide her. I can't be real. I can't tote my crystals around. I can't flip cards in front of them. It's weird to me. I want to be able to be free and do that. I think you need to tell them. I want the freedom to make my own decisions. And tell John when I'm comfortable. When I feel ready. It doesn't have to be when she wants me to. I need you to think about this what I'm about. Have you ever thought that the Christina, who she is when she's not with you, when she's with me, with whoever else, that that is the real Christina? How can John sit there and tell me that he knows my sister when he has no idea about anything about her childhood, about her psychic powers? She has no clue. Christina has been lying to you, John. You don't even know what she's doing. You're lying to you, John. You don't even know that. You're so oblivious to it all. Oh my god. I have to learn to do her because I didn't know this Christina. I didn't know that Christina. You know what? You know what? I don't know the Christina you've known. The one that caters to you. You can't hear. Oh my god. You're just not listening. You have to admit that I am listening. No, you're not listening. I'm listening. I'm listening.

7279424784335719710,Lauren Boebert FINALLY apologizes for blowing vape smoke in a pregnant woman’s face while watching Beetlejuice musical ," I'm sorry, but this Lauren Bobert story is so hilarious to me. There is just so much to unpack, but can we first start with this shady-ass daily male headline? Lauren Bobert finally apologizes for sleazy behavior that got her kicked out of Beatles' musical, blaming anxiety and her divorce, as 36-year-old grandma is slammed over fondling clip. Now, in case she missed it, there's a video that's come out. Lauren Bobert went to a Beatles' musical with her new boyfriend, and she was vaping, and this woman, this pregnant woman behind her was like telling her to stop, and apparently she was just like, no, you're sad and miserable. She denied vaping, but as you can see from the video, which TMZ so lovingly put into slow motion so we can truly capture the moment, she was absolutely vaping in the theater. But that's not even the funniest part to me. The pregnant woman is telling her, cut it out, and she's like, whatever, lady, get out. She's taking pictures with flash in the middle of the theater, and she's dancing. She really knows the Beatles' music. She is grue-vid. So then she gets kicked out of the theater by the usher, and of course, I'm sure she's not happy about it. So she has to pull her, like, do you know who I am thing? You're going to be sorry. I think she said she was going to call. I don't know who she said she was going to call, but they kick her out of the theater. I don't know why her boyfriend took so long to go, like, no, I'm going to kick that. You're going to. And on the way out, she's saying whatever, and she flips them the bird on the way out. So she issues this apology, which I'm sorry, the print is so small. She probably did that on purpose so people couldn't read it. You know, you could pause to read. But basically she said, like, you know, that she fell short of her values, and then she blamed, like, just going through, like, this divorce and anxiety. But my best part is she just was like, but it also could have just been the excitement of seeing a much anticipated production. Like, she loves Beatles' musical. I just don't understand why lie about it in the first place, because truthfully, if she had just been honest and been like, yeah, guys, sorry, I got caught vaping in the theater. I actually probably would have identified with her more. But no, instead you doubled down. You lied about it. Basically trying to make a pregnant woman look crazy. And then you get caught only because there's footage. And it's just like, if you're willing to lie about something as dumb as vaping in the theater, like, what else are you willing to lie about?",

Boy, the Republicans are doing all kinds of contortions to validate Lauren Bober's behavior. We'll start out with Joey Manorino. The media is lying to you in creating a scandal for nothing. The original story about Lauren Bober was that she was removed for taking videos during a performance. No one in the story mentioned anything except recording, singing, and possibly vaping. Then the theater puts out infrared security footage effectively doxing the woman on her date. And now the media says Lauren was thrown out because people saw her and her date engaged in sex acts. One, if that sex you people are clearly unaware of what sex is. Two, no one saw anything because you literally never knew about that part until they released the infrared camera security camera footage. You know if the media had any word of that, it would have been the lead part of the headline. So clearly you're being lied to. I mean, are people seriously falling for this bullshit? Ha ha. Hard as a rock. So Democrat Rick comes in to save the day. One, she was vaping directly in front of a pregnant woman which she was. Two, she was rudely singing and dancing during the performance, disturbing other theater goers. This was not a participation musical. And three, she was sexualizing kids by giving a free, groping show. She literally was doing this in front of children. So was he? This conduct is so unbefitting of a postal worker, no less a sitting congresswoman. She has to go. But Democrat Rick isn't done yet. Oh, and number four, she was taking photos, which you're not allowed to do. Five, she lied about what she did and didn't do until the video was released. And then she apologized. You know, maybe if she hadn't traded the staff at the Buel Theatre as badly as she did, maybe they wouldn't have released that footage to the news station. But she's no friend of anybody, especially the arts. So she doesn't get the friends treatment. And this is a stain that will never wash off of her for the rest of her life, her career, her children's lives, her grandchildren's lives. When somebody mentions Lauren Bobert, they're going to talk about beetle juice, Bobert juice, Bobert juice, Bobert juice.",

Her parents spent over 15K on her rushed wedding and she decided to just go to the courthouse instead. She changed her plans last minute after I said I was going to the courthouse myself. Her parents were furious. Not only was it a waste of their money they can't get back, but they also can't come down for the courthouse wedding they're doing. I also asked that they knew about the go fund me that she set up asking for donations in case anyone wants to help them celebrate and they said no. Her dad was having none of them called her to take it down. I'm not sure if it was taken down or not since I have her blocked on all social media now. About me lying about being pregnant, her parents and my parents, and most of my friends, were all in the loop about me lying. Her fiance kept spam calling and texting me about what kind of things I was buying for my baby and I told him a whole bunch of things. I made an Amazon wishlist and sent it to him. He did mention that it was kind of expensive but I kept saying how much I needed these items because they were so cute and that I knew my cousin would love them. They help. He ended up buying a lot of stuff. My cousin called me asking to go shopping with me for the babies and that's when I told her that mine was a false positive and how let them out was but that I was happy for her. Her fiance called me extremely ticked off because there were things he bought that he couldn't return and I should have told him sooner. I asked how that would matter since she is actually pregnant and he hung up. I talked to her mom and she told me that my cousin admitted to faking being pregnant and now her partner is upset with her for lying.",

So I went to my appointment yesterday to do my nst and a son of ramb. So I was explaining to them about the brachum picks I've been having over the past couple days. I mean I didn't have for none really yesterday but I'm explaining to her and I've been in pain having been able to sleep in this any third. So now she hooks me up to the machines and monitors to see if I'm having contractions. It's absolutely nothing. So at this moment she's looking at me like, um, miss, you must be praising. So I'm like, I don't know why it's not doing anything now but why as soon as she took me off the machine the raps and hicks start. But she's looking at me like I must be delusion. I'm like, miss, I know what was going on. So long story short, should I, oh, you need to see your old being? I haven't seen this old be since December 13th. Today is January 18th. Like I've been calling trying to make an appointment. This lady just refused to send in to that office phone. The last time I seen her she had the EMT coming get me because I was complaining about dizziness which turned out to be vertebral dehydration. I explained to her I felt dizzy. Next thing you know, they knocking on the door and taking me out. This woman never even explained to me what possibly could be happened and she never came to communicate with the EMT. Oh, she never came to even explain to the EMT why they was taking me and where she wanted me to go or nothing. So they're like, why is she not communicating with us? I'm like, I don't know. This lady is weird. So now I'm at the clinic where I desperately want to change my old be but no other clinic or doctor wants to take me at this moment because they've looked at me too far in my pregnancy and wants me to continue where I am. But I'm so unsatisfied. Like how am I supposed to trust this lady with my life or my newborn's life? Instructions are from the Unique properly. At first she seems to be okay but now it's like, I don't like her. I don't like her. I really don't like this lady. So when she sees me on the 30th, I hope she prepares because she's going to catch this smoke. She definitely will catch this smoke.",
7317011646252109087,"Ex-Smokers, how did you OVERCOME your ADDICTION to CIGARETTES? #redditstories #reddit #redditstorytimes #redditreadings #askreddit #redditstory494 This story may be adapted for more entertainment."," x-smokers, how did you overcome your addiction to cigarettes? So it all started with my mother. She smoked most of her life. She definitely didn't let up when she was pregnant with me. I was born under weight, as is typical. I was breastfed, and when she tried to wean me, I started having startling symptoms. Shaking, screaming. She thought I was having a seizure. Dr. said I was going through nicotine withdrawal as a baby. I was jonesing for my nicotine fixed to the point I'd bully my younger brother off the honker. I got at least a good two solid years of breastfeeding, monopolizing it to the point where my mom got so sick of breastfeeding that she took my brother off early. Smoking was in the house constantly. I always wanted to sit by mommy when she smoked. The fumes were a part of my life. I started officially smoking at 12. All my friends coughing? Evan casuals, I ripped the filters off because that's how mommy do. I moved on from those Virginia slims to Marborough with the filters ripped off. By the time I was 16 I decided to come out with my habit to my mother because I figured only an idiot couldn't tell I was a smoker. I mean, she could even smell it because of the brand change. Well, she cried, yelled and I was just staring at her dump-founded. She tried her best to make me feel like a worthless, weak piece of crap for picking up this habit that she tried so hard to shield me from and that she raised me better. Then she lights a cigarette up and says look how much you've stressed me out. This is coming from the woman that when I begged her to quit when I was younger she screamed in my face that this was one thing in her life that she could enjoy. So, she verbally and emotionally abuses me from this point out. Her room smells disgusting because you smoke. I'm going to start smoking outside because I don't want this house to smell like crap. Yeah that lasted a week. Anyways I turned 18 soon after. I officially and legally can smoke. Mum. Start sending me off to pick up the smokes. When life gives lemons you make lemonade I guess. She also never, never let me off the hook. Always had something to say about me smoking and how she wasn't as bad. I smoked those menthol ones for a bit. Started coughing up lead. Decided to stop those. I stopped eating much. I then lived off of cigarettes and Dr. Pepper. Leading to me dropping to 94 pounds. So then I turned 19. I met a guy who doesn't smoke. I decided that year I'm going to quit. My mum, desperate to somehow keep on some level with me, says she's going to do it too. Well my boyfriend helped me quit, I used the patches for about two weeks. Then I just got effing tired of using them so I stopped them and went cold turkey. My mum fell off the wagon and tried to hide it from me but with me getting my sense of smell back, as well as her coughing up chunks of tar. I could smell it all over her. She then started trying to control my life more. She now doesn't want to let me go anywhere and says I have to stay home and watch my brother. I ran away from home when I was 20 and didn't talk to her a few years because she insisted on keeping the relationship toxic. I now haven't smoked in nearly 10 years. But I still dream of cigarettes. It's still a struggle. I think about going back to it all the time.","Poster, Flower, Toy, Stairs, Common sunflower, Bookcase, Curtain, Table, Building, Window, Shelf, Plant, Tree Pepper., The fumes, ch., change., me,, she screamed, TITok, life., oTikTOk, the point, edr y mother, cigarettes., brother, early., the wagon, HH, menthol, X, off, INT, dumbfounde, Q 99+, @redditstory484, w, I was, of mylife, tired, wom, Smoking, I officially, stressed, lused the, I started, Ialways, come out, d TikTok, @redaitstory494, lemonade, Tik To, my brother., her., |, guess., when she, smoke., CIGARETTES?, c TikTok, how did you, Butl, whenl was, an, @redditstory, TikTOk, T, baby., UP, oTikTok, 2, started, You, crap"", (as, Ex-Smokers, his, Tik Tok, going, gives, That, hat, because, filters, me but, monopolizing, for my, Shaking,, definitely, to sit, She smoked, quit., C TikTok, c, @re ditstory494, C TiTOK, Started, shield, dditstory494, outside, C TikTOk, stop, ten years., TikTok, 99+ Q 99+, 16, do., chunks of, Anyways, Then, Redditstory494, off., her life, She, struggle., So,, smell, I mean,, She tried, ny mother, smoking, having, O TikTok, TikTOR, smokes., I turned, C TiKTOK, >, vithdrawal, me, a smoker., stilla, disgusting, O TikTOk, patches, Always, can, L Share, o TikTok, never, cigarettes, cried,, slims, Ch TikTok, point, she thought, brand, TkTok, a, emotionally, Haven't, about, k, turkey., c TikTOk, -, mom,, twelve., I have, bad., a seizure., helped me, cTikTok, dTikTok, reddistory494, Redditstory494@, she, aguy, to 94, after., breastfed,, those., d., 19., 494, keeping, blood.., TiKTOk, I, watch, Effing, the honker., @redditstory494, TiKTOK, coughing?, startling, Orede GVERCOME your ADDICTION to, toxic., somehow, Mom, life, ikTo, smoked., =, 99+, pregnant, that 'she, ikTok, talk, I then, @recditstory494, of, starts, My, Istopped, typical., two weeks., @red GVERCOME your ADDICTION to, sick, me., make, underweight,, wasn't, constantly., out.', at least, worthless,, It's, screaming."

You may know me formally as the smokestop buddy, but now I'm just playing all Katie Roads. Mother to be. I got all the smokestop because I found out I was pregnant. I am now 13 weeks pregnant. And this has been like a rollercoaster of events. I was so sick. The first 10 weeks of pregnancy. I was nauseous. I wasn't even throwing up. Like I just felt disgusting. It was like, it literally how I told all my friends I was like, I feel like I have a hangover. I'm never ending hangover and I had no fun the night before. At all. So now I'm actually feeling better. I want to start being tipped-talks again. But definitely my content's going to switch over. I'm not going to be talking about smokestop related things anymore. Maybe we'll go visit every now and then. But definitely going more towards pregnancy stuff because this pregnancy has been insane. I went to the doctor yesterday to save a head, a urinary tract infection. Turns out I didn't have one. But when they did my P analysis, they found out that there are key tones present in my body. If you don't know what key tones are, it's when you go into ketosis on a diet where you eat no carbs. This was very alarming to my doctor. She's like, you're pregnant. You need to be eating. Are you not eating? I was like, yes, I'm eating. She's like, what did you eat today? I was all if you must ask. I had eggs, bacon, cinnamon toast, and a cinnamon roll for breakfast. And then for lunch, I had a KFC. I had a KFC chicken sandwich, a large french fry, two biscuits. Like, I'm eating, lady. And I heard the best news of my life. She's like, okay. Well, I think you need to be eating more. You need to up your calorie intake and drink a lot more water. And I was just like, what? I guess it makes sense because I have been losing weight since I got pregnant. Like, I weigh less than I did when I found out that was pregnant. Like, 10, 15 pounds less. So this will be interesting.

7201683387499728174,"Today I am thankful for finished floors, a husband and FIL who can put up with smoke, and compression socks #33weekspregant #homerenovation #homeremodel #pregnantlife #pregnanttiktok ", Join me for a day in the life of a very pregnant lady who lives with her in-laws because the house renovation project that her and her husband took on is not complete yet. I'm really excited about today because we are going over to the house to do a full work day so I'm excited to see it. It's been about two weeks since I've seen it due to travel and letting the floors dry. I had to take Margo on a walk before we headed over there. Quick fit check. It was pretty cold today to be honest. Here it is. Here are the floors. They look amazing. Thank goodness they were dry so we could walk around on them and so everything starting off next week could go off without a hitch. But I'm really excited about the floors and the texture you can see. Here are all of our lights. Our electrician is coming on Monday so we sorted the lights and put them all in the room that they go to. Here's that outside. You can see there's still a ton of work to be done so we're going to burn some of this trash today. Here's me and my mother and last setting up some shelves that my some of my work stuff will go on that can feed outside in a shed. But as you could you could see the outside needs a ton of work and so that's really what we focused on mostly today. Checking on the burn pile. There it is and then I decided to rake leaves. There are little crevices and corners like this all over our property that just need a ton of TLC. Once the smoke got too bad I decided to call quits and headed back home took Marjo out for another little short walk. Met my activity goal today so that's exciting. And then I had to have a quick snack because I didn't eat lunch really so I had to get something in and then I had to get the smell of smoke off with me. I just cannot stand it so I had to do a full hair wash routine which is not my favorite but you know it is what it is. I washed my hair about twice a week and then during the hair drying session is when I really started to stress out and started to think to myself did I contribute enough to the house project today was there something else I could have done? Was there something I missed? And so really started to kind of have a little bit of an existential crisis during my hair session. But I am really excited about what we've got coming up this week. I don't want to tell you guys because I don't want to jinx it and have something not come off but I will bring you along every step of the way as we get new and exciting things in. And I tried out this heatless curls and I've done heatless curl several times it works pretty well. There's my fit and I relaxed with my compression socks on which is awesome. And then we're going to spend the rest of the evening eating pizza and relaxing and watching movies and that is it.,"Strawberry, Picture frame, Chair, Pillow, Person, Microphone, Dog, Clothing, House, Trousers, Bed, Human face, Woman, Box, Plate, Clock, Tree, Door, Girl, Cabinetry, Jacket, Footwear, Window Brom Design, sign, DECORAIOAS, TiKTok, JNOH, J TikTOk, 8 435, d TikTok, .@odlekay, RROWN COW, steps, d TiKTOk, c TikTok, Yo, @odiek, TikTOk, T, 19b31sqyH, 2, Or, Tik Tok, :, @odlekay, ROWN COW, C TikTok, & TikTOk, EROWN COW, SOME, DOG, d TikTOk, ROWN, BromiDesign, C TikTOk, o TiKTok, TikTok, o TikTOk, Details, O TikTok, Bromi De, HyperEden, Bromi Design, O TikTOk, REXE, mid, podiekay, Dem, o TikTok, P, a, HOME, -, HAbeLo, c TikTOK, ghts .

7182566015841226026,#abusiveparents #abusivefamily #blacksheep #triggerwarning #lorenmolloy ," Some look at me and think I had an easy life and that's ridiculous. My mother had 1,000 by proxy. Literally, she would tell me when she was young that when she was pregnant with me she used to smoke cigarettes, hoping that she would miscarry me. When I was little, she found out I was highly, deathly allergic to down feathers. She bought me down jackets, down bed covers, down bledding, bedding, anything that had feathers hoping to kill me. I was put in the hospital numerous times because of things she did to the point where doctors were like, we're gonna have to call CPS soon. So she got smarter. But my father was an attorney who loved to just randomly sue and ruin anybody's life. So every time somebody would threaten, he'd be like, oh no, that might make me look bad because I'm trying to be a judge who he never would be. So then he would go so a doctor, so a hospital and they'd be like, never mind, never mind. So I was never able to be saved. My father molested me when I was a child and abused me. My brother and my mother told me I was crazy. My doctors and psychiatrist said no, she's not crazy. She has all the signs. I just found out this morning that my mother forged my name in 2011 and took out my entire retirement account but told me that they just deleted it. So there was a check she took. She forged my name. Meanwhile around the same time in 2011, she threw me out of the house, made me homeless, installed all the money on my bank account because we both have El Maloy as her first initial and last name. So they let her. I was homeless with no money. She then canceled my credit cards, my cell phone, forcing me to stay homeless and then told all the family, I tried to harm her and that's why I got kicked out. I have never, ever raised a hand to my mother in my entire life. I wouldn't want that on my soul. So if you think I've had an easy life, you don't see the scars that God had on the inside. My mother broke my tailbone when I was a small child with my own door knob to punish me from running away from her when I was a little kid because she had a metal frying pan in her hand. My brother pretends that I am just a psychopath and he is great. So is my sister-in-law. I never had find my algebra. I was just lazy. I didn't have PTSD. I am just a mean brat. None of that is true. My mother had my child's in my proxy. To this day, people still think that I am a villain and she was a glorious soul. Having no idea, she used to poison my coffee and poison my food. How do I know? Because those are the moments that she wasn't hungry. Where she was just drinking water instead of coffee and this is a woman who was fueling coffee 24 hours a day. This woman is a fucking villain and if you knew Linda Malloy and you thought she was nice, she conned you.

7213854408994524422,"Things we can tell by looking in your mouth! 👄  1. If you have an eating disorder like bulimia nervosa. Frequent vomiting can erode your tooth enamel, especially on the tongue side of the upper front teeth. This can also lead to an increase in the susceptibility to and number of cavities when teeth no longer have their protective enamel covering. With repeated vomiting, teeth are permanently eroded and may begin to discolor or change in shape, size, or length. They often become weaker, more translucent, and brittle. The patient also may mention that they are experiencing sensitivity and dry mouth. We can also notice redness on the inside of the throat.  Bulimia causes the salivary glands to enlarge, leading to significant cheek puffiness.  2. We can tell if you smoke. The most noticeable effect of smoking on your teeth is the yellow or even brown staining it causes on their surfaces. Bone loss is more pronounced in smokers than non smokers! People who smoke are more likely to produce plaque, thus, leading to receding gums and eventually gum disease. Smoking represses the immune system which can make smoker’s gums more susceptible to infection.  Those who drink heavily often have dry mouths, as alcohol can reduce saliva production. Heavy drinkers also face an increased risk of oral cancer. 3. Your dental hygienist may be able to tell that you are pregnant. You may present with pregnancy gingivitis where the gums become more inflamed, red, tender and bleed easily.  4. Patients that bite their nails using their front teeth usually have leveled off, flat front teeth. Erosion, chipping, and cracking as well as wear and tear: the grinding friction of teeth against nails can gradually wear the enamel away, or even cause teeth to chip or crack. Biting nails doesn't just damage the teeth, it can also cause them to move, leading to malocclusions (problems with the bite) and gaps. #dentalhygienepractitioner #dentalhygienist #dentalthings #dentaltok #dentalfacts #dentalknowledge #dentalhacks #dentaltips #dentaltipsandtricks #oralhygiene #oralhygienetips #oralhealth #oralhealtheducation #oralhealthawareness #scrublife #newgrad #teeth #dentalvibes #dentistryworld #dentistry"," Hit the button for seeing the girl down Play short, it was her, not none Girl let's get this thing track and hack You just been dead on over I'll get behind and you'll take me while","Human face, Clothing, Woman, Person @ash.dos, O TikTok, Pregnancy, I, C TikTok, -, TikTok, o TikTok, Things we can tell by, Alcohol drinker, looking in your mouth, Smoking, Eating disorders, heavy, C TIKTOK"
7316330191427472686,Omg😢🥺 #reddit #redditstories #redditreadings #askreddit #minecraft #minecraftparkour #storytime #beaststories #fyp ," X-smokers, how did you overcome your addiction to cigarettes? So it all started with my mother. She smoked most of her life. She definitely didn't let up when she was pregnant with me. I was born under weight, as is typical. I was breastfed, and when she tried to wean me, I started having startling symptoms. Shaking, screaming. She thought I was having a seizure. Dr. Sett I was going through nicotine withdrawal as a baby. I was jonesing for my nicotine fixed to the point I'd bully my younger brother off the honker. I got at least a good two solid years of breastfeeding, monopolizing it to the point where my mom got so sick of breastfeeding that she took my brother off early. Smoking was in the house constantly. I always wanted to sit by mommy when she smoked. The fumes were a part of my life. I started officially smoking at 12. All my friends coughing? Evan Casuals, I ripped the filters off because that's how mommy do. I moved on from those Virginia slums to Marborough with the filters ripped off. By the time I was 16 I decided to come out with my habit to my mother because I figured only an idiot couldn't tell I was a smoker. I mean, she could even smell it because of the brand change. Well, she cried, yelled and I was just staring at her dump-founded. She tried her best to make me feel like a worthless, weak piece of crap for picking up this habit that she tried so hard to shield me from and that she raised me better. Then she lights a cigarette up and says look how much you've stressed me out. This is coming from the woman that when I begged her to quit when I was younger she screamed in my face that this was one thing in her life that she could enjoy. So, she verbally and emotionally abuses me from this point out. Your room smells disgusting because you smoke. I'm going to start smoking outside because I don't want this house to smell like crap. Yeah, that lasted a week. Anyways, I turned 18 soon after. I officially and legally can smoke. Mom. Start sending me off to pick up the smokes. When life gives lemons you make lemonade I guess. She also never, never let me off the hook. Always had something to say about me smoking and how she wasn't as bad. I smoked those menthol ones for a bit. Started coughing up blood. Decided to stop those. I stopped eating much. I then lived off of cigarettes and Dr. Pepper. Leading to me dropping to 94 pounds. So then I turned 19. I met a guy who doesn't smoke. I decided that year I'm going to quit. My mom, desperate to somehow keep on some level with me, says she's going to do it too. Well, my boyfriend helped me quit. I used the patches for about two weeks. Then I just got effing tired of using them so I stopped them and went cold turkey. My mom fell off the wagon and tried to hide it from me but with me getting my sense of smell back, as well as her coughing up chunks of tar, I could smell it all over her. She then started trying to control my life more. She now doesn't want to let me go anywhere and says I have to stay home and watch my brother. I ran away from home when I was 20 and didn't talk to her a few years because she insisted on keeping the relationship toxic. I now haven't smoked the nearly 10 years. But I still dream of cigarettes. It's still a struggle. I think about going back to it all the time.","Poster, Toy, Swimming Pool, Building, Plant, Tree BLOOD, 1 Share, PATCHES, VIRGINIA, CTikTOk, CRIED, A, CRAP, DROPPING, MUCH, STARTED, MY, TOOK, CIGARETTES, HONKER, BREASTFED, d TikTok, YOUNCER, TO, IN, beaststoriesofficial, POINT, THIS, TH, LOOK, WERE, c TikTok, ME, Q, QUIT, THAT, TikTOk, BRAND, HAVEN'T, OFF, WEEKS, MOTHER, YEAR, Ex-Smokers, addiction to cigarettes?, Tik Tok, PICKING, START, WHO, ICAL, MOST, POUNDS, C TikTok, SHE, DIDN'T, GOING, WITH, C TikTOk, TikTok, MOMMY, SMOKE, NEVER, t Share, USING, BACK, OUTSIDE, 12, LEAST, WITHDRAWAL, FEEL, NINETEEN, @beaststoriesofficial, FROM, HIDE, ALWAYS, o TikTok, DUMBFOUNDED, P, a, SEIZURE, FILTERS, IS, -, 3, TURKEY, how did you overcome your, BETTER, ONLY, SHAKING, AFTER, PEPPER, OFFICIALLY, So, CASUALS, SYMPTOMS, THOUCHT, THOSE, WAS, TURNED, I, DECIDED, GUESS, JUST, TRIED, J, SMOKING, AND, WOW, 5, 99+, SOMETHING, SCREAMING, ENJOY, OUT, SICK, S, STILL, EMOTIONALLY, SMOKED, d, LIFE, EARLY, CONSTANTLY, J., HOOK, KEEP, HER, LEMONS, YEARS"

A mommy makeover. 5 yrs ago. • ….. & no, I was never going for a “natural” look & no, i dont hate myself. 😂 I planned & saved & waited for 13 yrs bf i went through with it. Bf it was such a fad on social media. • I have the same man I had pre-op ….so i didnt do it for that either. I just wanted to like what i saw when i looked in the mirror. Sure, I still have many insecurities like most women, but im happy with me at present & if Im unhappy with something in the future….I’ll change that too.  • Despite weird & invalid opinions, i do eat well & workout to maintain results. Im almost 40….i HAVE to for my health & wellness. I was active before & an athlete all of my life.  I went from 115 to 197 diring my pregnancy 18 yrs ago. A combo of quitting smoking while pregnant (duhhhh) & eating everything that was offered to me. Couple that with a few years of post partum depression + eating only the same pizza, fries & nuggets that my autistic son would tolerate & voila….a hot mess of a body  • I lost weight prior to surgery. I was 215 at my heaviest 😨 & was left with a sagging skirt of skin & stretchmakrs around my abdomen after weight loss. I couldnt even see my 🐱 without moving it out of the way.  YIKES! No amount of exercise would cure that. Consulted with my doc…& the rest is history. I shared my full surgery journey & post op journey on IG when it happened + mini maintenance procedures as theyve happened. If you were there i was very transparent, but note I dont feel onbligated to post a disclaimer abt my body everytime it appears in a video. IDC that much….& honestlh neither should you. I’m more than my body & you see that with every other thing i post. Its 2024, its hardly news that folsk have surgery, but pigenholing someone into a certain category based on that one fact is childish & played out IMO. So there.

7307957254756715822,"Ex-Smokers, how did you OVERCOME your ADDICTION to CIGARETTES?  #reddit #redditstories #redditreadings #storytelling "," smokers, how did you overcome your addiction to cigarettes? So it all started with my mother. She smoked most of her life. She definitely didn't let up when she was pregnant with me. I was born under weight, as is typical. I was breastfed, and when she tried to wean me, I started having startling symptoms. Shaking, screening. She thought I was having a seizure. Dr. Sada was going through nicotine withdrawal as a baby. I was jonesing for my nicotine fixed to the point I'd bully my younger brother off the honker. I got at least a good two solid years of breastfeeding, monopolizing it to the point where my mom got so sick of breastfeeding that she took my brother off early. Smoking was in the house constantly. I always wanted to sit by mommy when she smoked. The fumes were a part of my life. I started officially smoking at 12. All my friends coughing? Evan Casuals, I ripped the filters off because that's how mommy do. I moved on from those Virginia slums to Marborough with the filters ripped off. By the time I was 16, I decided to come out with my habit to my mother because I figured only an idiot couldn't tell I was a smoker. I mean, she could even snow it because of the brand change. Well, she cried, yelled and I was just staring at her dump-founded. She tried her best to make me feel like a worthless, weak piece of crap for picking up this habit that she tried so hard to shield me from and that she raised me better.",
7278724886648900907,#tiktok #knowledgerelated #mosquitoes #test ," After quitting smoking, does the body come back to health? Smoking not only makes it harder for women to get pregnant, it can also cause men to lose their virility. With every puff of a cigarette, there are more than 5,000 chemical compounds. Into your body, these harmful substances not only damage tooth and amel and damage the nerve endings of smell and taste, and they can damage the cilia that clean the respiratory tract and increase the risk of lung infections. And what's worse, chemicals can cause genetic mutations that make the body less resistant to cancer. Not only that, the chemicals and cigarettes, like nicotine, can thicken the walls of blood vessels, platelets become sticky, which can lead to various cardiovascular diseases. Although long-term smoking can seriously affect your health, but if you start quitting now, after one day, your blood pressure and heart rate will return to normal, and your risk of heart attack will start to drop. In two days, the nerve endings of smell and taste will begin to repair themselves. If you can last a month, the health of your lungs will improve dramatically. Symptoms like coughing and shortness of breath will be relieved, but don't get too excited. The damaged hair like cilia will take at least 9 months to repair. Once the cilia are back to normal, they'll be able to strengthen, to clean up foreign objects like dust and bacteria. If you keep at it for a year, then cardiovascular disease will gradually improve. The risk of a heart attack is cut in half at this point. After 5 years, the chances of blood clots plummeting, the risk of stroke will continue to decrease. After 10 years, the body's ability to repair DNA is fully restored. The risk of lung cancer drops by 50 percent. After 15 years, the risk of coronary heart disease can be reduced to the same level as non-smokers. This shows that after quitting smoking, the body can regain its health, but it takes a long time, and nicotine induced withdrawal is very painful. Once you can't stand the temptation, you'll lose all you've gained. You have to have enough self-control to keep going.","Poster, Toy, Rose, Cake, Knife, Human face, Clothing, Bird, Boy, Woman, Man, Footwear, Wall Clock, Person, Tree ;00:03:13, ihthylamin, 01:05:02, 17 18 19 20, X X XXXX), 00;59;05, 00:50:00, Smoking not only makes it, chemical compounds, Once you can't stand the temptation, Quinoline, 30, odiker, 00:49:05, c TikTok, 00:00, 00:24,05, 16 17 19 19 20, self-control to keep going, Hack, 2, 24 25 26 27, Although long-term smoking car, Acrylonitrile, Crotonaldehyde, Propional, 10 1 12 13, This shows that after quitting smoking, c Tik Tok, Does the body come back to health, NCER, Niske Oxide, ;01:00;02, DIA, Propionalte, orner Smoker T Non-Smoker, ;01;00:27, NNT, 29, ry, ene Resrcinol, eart, And your risk of heart attack will stant to drop, ;01:08:12, 00;, It can also cause men to lose their virility, 01:05:27, P, X XXXX), 01:04:07, :00;52;15, 19:02, Htack, And damage the nerve, 19 19 20, X XX X, O, ;30.00, 00:0, Will take at least 9 months to repair, o, And they can damage the cilia, XXXX, 00:05:23, MONTH 1, ;00:41, 29 29 30 31, of, Cadmium, 00:17.10, XXXX>, Acrolein, 2-naphithylaini, and NA, ice, YEARS, SYS, h, 20, Isopren, 00:33 10, ;00;27;15, A, 2-naphthylar, 8, Benzopyrene, E, 5.20, Can quitting smoking bring you, d TikTok, As, |, 01;15:2, ;00;54:05, ie, Carbon Monoxide, The damaged hair-like cilia, NNN NK and N, 01:03:12, to, smoker, MONT, Butyraluenyde, After quitting smoking, igh, ISe, the body's ability to repair DNA is fully restored, The health of your lungs will improve dramatically, shortness of breath will be relieved, @thordikecogan, lydro, The chemicals in cigarettes, 25 26 27, There are more than 5,000, X XXX, Cresol, 12, 00;16:20, 007, 01:0, :00,29,0, 01:02:17, Benzene, o TikTok, MONTHI, If you can last a month, And they can damage the cilial, Catechol, Ammonia, 24, 3, You have to have enough, 3 4 56, NMik@xide, cTikTok, Nickel, the body can regain its health, Not only that, 4 56, After one day, 00,15,25, To clean up foreign objects, C, I, 00:40:25, J, Ni, they'll be able to strengthen, 15, 01, Propionalk, 17, St, 00:04, 5, Propianaldehy, XXXXX, d TTO, And nicotine-induced withdrawal is very painful, 31, :00:00:20, lows, High, Butyraldehyde, ;01-09:07, Quinolinfidine, Into your body, ;00,55,00, Acrlenitle Ledmlur, ;00:18,1, 200, With every puff of a cigarette, Phenol, X XXXXX, After 15 years, The risk of lung cancer drops by 50%, .00:46.23, X X>, 00;58;10, And what's worse, But if you start quitting now, 01:21,, @the dikecogan, the risk of coronary heart disease, 9 Se X, hydroquinone, rate will return to normal, ive, Oh, 000, R, 9, 14, -ve, Eve, MONTHS, ""Styre, X XX, 00.5, 10:2, Chemicals can cause genetic mutations, 00;28;10, low, 00:05:03, 00:01:20, 10:3, U, 00;12,, The risk of a heart attack is, endings Of smell and taste, pog, like dust and bacteria, Styren, will gradually improve, Propionaldehyde, Once the cilia are back to normal, 00;57;15, That make the body less resistant to cancer, 25 26, 01;15:02, 01:06,22, But don't get too excited, :00,10,02, 01:24,00, 00,13:10, 00,51:20, X X X X, X X 3 4 56, You'll lose all you've gained, -, 00,25, 00,30.20, level as non-smokers, In two days, Ice, Oorner Smoker .

The appointment today was for a program called Q-Tip, which I find slightly amusing, but it's actually a quick tobacco and pregnancy. I get to pretend I'm a toddler for a while. It's a rewards-based system, so basically today I went in and we got a packet. We talked about what my triggers for smoking are. Things like that. I'm going to go for the water bottle and the water bottle, if I can get it open, hang on a second here. Has a straw and that's actually really important because the straw kind of gives you that whole hand-amount with sucky motion, which smoking would give you, which hopefully, we'll help. We'll see. I'm going to try to find something I actually like to drink to put in it, but I'm not going to put chocolate milk in. It's kind of been fading as a drink for me anyway, but you also go over all the things that are triggers for you and ways to kind of cut back more to get ready to quit at different options available. For me, the best way to do it is to gut down. Right now, the goal is to get down to four to five a day. Once I can get down to that, then we'll go for the quitting portion. I'll have another appointment in a month, which I will go in for and every time you go in, including today, they do a carbon monoxide breathing test to show how high your carbon monoxide is in your system. Each time you go in and you do that breath test, you get to pick out of the prizes and that kind of helps to raise the dopamine in your brain, which is what smoking gives you. It's what the nicotine does. It's the same way you would try to help a toddler to fix a behavior or a child to fix a behavior. But the problem is we don't realize that we don't have a lot of rewards in this world today. We don't have a lot of real things that make us feel good. I'll go back in about a month and we'll do the carbon monoxide. The goal right now is, I don't remember what we're getting it down to, but I've got all of that. Then once I go in and do that again, then I get to pick another prize, which for me right now will probably be the movie wrap because I'm a baby wearer. That's the number one thing I want. Then she asked if there were other things that I think would be good up there, so I told her definitely like diaper inserts because I prefer reusable diapers over disposable because it's a lot cheaper in the long run. I also have a lot of my kids have issues with a lot of the diapers we used. So today is just more health and support to quit because that is my goal is to quit before he gets here. But yeah, figured I would give you guys all a little bit of an update of what that program is and how that program works. So if you live here in Oregon, if you're pregnant, if you're trying to quit, definitely contact Wick. Talk to Q-Tip. Get in the program because even if you don't succeed, any support that you can get is going to be positive in this regard when it comes to pregnancy. So I guess that's my up to anything you want to add? No. And when she's done, it's my turn. He's going to quit after I do. That way we have no reason to restart. Ever. Wish us luck guys.","Bottle, Human face, Clothing, Boy, Woman, Girl, Man, Person 2, CTiKTOK, C, I, @sunsgod, d rikTok, O, J, :, umit, @sunsgodess, b, CTikTOk, YIH, 6, 163, amng, O TikTOk, C TikTok, E, o, amnd, TiKTok, CTIRTOk, OTikTok, o TikTok, w, TikTol, o TiTOk, @sunsgodes, e TikTok, ikTok, a, smito, rikTok, C TikTOk, -, aming, d TikTok, 3, 9, db), TikTo, TikTok, o TiKTok, |, J1, smig, aing, 0, cTikTok, TIKTOK, ar, c TikTok, TT, yonnps9 ni e, @sunsgode, emng, CTikTok, >mig, saing, 9ITS, C TikTOK, T, @sunsgadess"

You can't take medicine. You can't take like nightquill or anything like that. And the only pain killer you can take is like Tylenol. And they don't even recommend that. You can't eat deli meat or raw fish. So no sushi. You can't get filler. You can't get lip filler. You can't get Botox. You can't do any fun stuff like roller coasters, horseback riding. You can't jump on a trampoline. You can't sleep on your stomach. And you can't sleep on your back in the last trimester.

I mean, I succeeded once. I'm almost stupid, ladies. I picked up a cigarette with a friend. And that was the end of it. This time I was pregnant. And it was my first pregnancy. And it was so sick. And I was sick of my other two, but cigarettes never bothered me. Actually, they helped me in a cell, which is bad, because I didn't quit smoking. It's my first two hormones.

7289188601806556459,🙅🏽‍♀️❌🚫 Things I’m not allowing with my newborn baby in my second pregnancy  #momsoftiktok #fyp #pregnantlife #secondpregnancy #pregnantmama #pregnant #viral, Good morning. Get ready with me while I list the things that I will not be allowing in my second pregnancy. First things first I will not be allowing any visitors to the house in the first probably 30 days after I give birth and maybe longer than that. Secondly I will not be allowing anybody in the delivery room. It's actually kind of weird to me for people to see me all exposed and stuff like that. I was very strict on that when I was pregnant with Aidan and everybody kept telling me like you're gonna want somebody in there like you're gonna want your mom in there like somebody like a female you're gonna want somebody in there with you while you're giving birth and I was like no I loved it when I was pregnant with Aidan and it was just me and Sean that was a vulnerable moment for us and I'm gonna love it again with this baby it's just gonna be me and him. Kissing on my newborn baby negative. Act actually keep your face and your lips as far away from my child as possible. This should be common sense for anybody to not kiss a newborn baby like why would you do that? Don't pass him around while you're holding him. If I give him to you then that means you give him back to me and I will give him to someone else because I may not want that person holding him. Really I'm not allowing certain amount of people in the house when I do allow visitors at like at a time but really don't I mean like we're not we're not passing him around. This is not no and I would just address that issue when it's there probably not gonna have that issue but I feel like I feel like I need to say it anyway. When my son is crying give him back to me give him back to me or give him back to his dad like whoever was ever present at the time and we will figure out what's wrong with him but more than likely while I'm in PPV I'm probably gonna want my baby if he's crying it's gonna it's just gonna be like a just give him back to me we don't need to talk about it. Oh my god this was like the egg for me when I was when I had when I just had a didn't when I was trying to like breastfeed and stuff I really don't like people hovering while I'm trying to breastfeed especially as a new mom like I don't really want the critique I don't need people like if I don't ask for it just don't offer it. I'll hover when I'm feeding don't hover when I'm changing his diaper just don't hover just if I leave the room that doesn't mean you leave to. This kind of goes into the hovering thing but like the suggestions like no suggestions I don't I don't need I don't need to tell me I just I don't just keep it to yourself. If I don't ask for it I don't need it I'm here into you I'm not gonna ask for it but keep your advice your suggestions your what you did when you were pregnant what you did when you had a newborn baby just keep it to yourself. No I didn't ask. No you cannot change his diaper. I don't think anybody has changed Aidan's diaper until he was like seven months. I'm the only one because she actually came down to help me in that first week after I had Aidan so of course like of course. No you cannot keep my new born baby fun like period. You can't watch him for a couple of hours you can't watch him overnight you don't ask but I feel like because I had Aidan there's gonna be someone who's gonna be like okay well you know like let me just keep you know give you a break and you know and I get it like it's cool but honestly like during that time I really just want to be a new born bliss like most like the the most important time that you can have with your kid is like the beginning stages skin to skin breastfeeding just being with them all day like that you literally just got ripped from my womb and now everybody is already trying to touch you and hold you and take you away from me like no I didn't have that issue with Aidan somebody actually did ask if they can keep him when he was like two months and I was like are you crazy? I'm just not getting to a point where I'm allowing people to keep Aidan. So this is kind of something I feel like I don't have to say honestly no smokers like we don't we're not smokers me and Shawn we don't allow smoking in our house there will be no smoking anywhere close to my kid so if you smoke don't come because it's gonna piss me off I didn't have this problem with Aidan I cannot stand the smell of marijuana or tobacco or vapes I don't like it I don't want it around me why do I still have these on? okay lastly now visitors at the hospital with an exception of like two people but I don't want like everybody coming to the hospital hovering and like we're still legitimately in the hospital I don't even know why you would ask like I said that's a really intimate time for me and Shawn I want it to be just me and him and like my mom's gonna be in town keeping Aidan while I'm in labor she's allowed to come because only because I want to see my son with the exception of two people they know who they are but no visitors in hospital that's it so thank you guys for watching I'll see you later bye,"Pen, Flower, Fashion accessory, Camera, Power plugs and sockets, Mobile Phone, Banana, Man, Bottle, Necklace, Human face, Clothing, Glove, Dress, Sink, Person hewborn, ANTICAVITY FLUORIDE RINSE, ctikTok, hospital, LNBORATOIRE DERMATOLOGIQUE, house for the first 80+, DENTIST FORMULATED, Tik TOk, ORAL RINSE, house for the first 30+, C TiKTOk, CTikTOk, IAMA, A, 9. on't ro keepmy, 10.

7320096216619142446,#learnontiktok #smokingisinjurioustohealth #fyp #science ," Does the body come back full circle to health after quitting smoking? Smoking not only makes it harder for women to get pregnant, it can also make men worse off in some way, every time you take a drag on a cigarette. There are more than chemicals in your body, these harmful substances not only damage tooth enamel. They also damage nerve endings in the senses otomel and taste, and they damage the sillier that clean the respiratory tract. And increase the risk of lung infections. What's worse, chemicals can cause genetic mutations that make the body less resistant to cancer, not only that, but chemicals in cigarettes, like nicotine, can thicken the walls of blood vessels. And make platelets sticky, which can lead to various cardiovascular diseases, although long term smoking can seriously affect your health. But if you start quitting now, then after one day, your blood pressure and heart rate will return to normal. Your risk of heart attack will start to decrease. In two days, the nerve endings of smell and taste will begin to repair themselves. If you've got a month without cracking, the health of your lungs will improve dramatically. Symptoms like coughing and shortness of breath will be relieved, but don't get too excited. The damaged hair like sillier will take at least nine months to repair, once the sillier return to normal. They'll be able to clean up for an object like dust and bacteria. If you stick with it, a year and don't give up, then cardiovascular disease will gradually improve. At this point, the risk of a heart attack is cut in half after five years. The chances of blood clots plummeting, the risk of stroke will continue to decrease. After ten years, the body's ability to repair DNA is fully restored. The risk of lung cancer drops by 50% after 15 years. The risk of coronary heart disease is the same as a non-smoker. This shows that the body can regain its health after quitting smoking, but it takes a long time, and nicotine induced withdrawal is very painful. Once you can't stand the temptation, it's all gone. So you have to have enough self-control to keep going. Follow me. Take you to learn more interesting knowledge.",

Let's call her Ruth. For backstory, Ruth makes the worst choices when presented the options. In high school she got involved with drugs of some sort and eventually married a guy we all assumed to have been her dealer. He had a kid already and Ruth was happy to have a pre-built family so to speak. Her husband never graduated high school and can't keep a job. Ruth did graduate, but never pursued education from there, which is fine. Neither did I, but sticks with minimum wage jobs. The few times she had gotten better paying jobs she has been fired for sleeping in and missing shifts, or will straight up quit cause it's not the vibe she wants. She eventually cheated on her husband with her new dealer so they divorced. The new dealer got her into meth and they both were eventually arrested for possession and various other things. We all thought the jail time would snap her out of her chaos, but she did what she always does and shifted the blame to whoever else she could. Our mom bailed her out, paid the impound for her car, etc. to try and get her on her feet. Ruth recently got back with her ex-husband and just now told our mom she is pregnant. She lives in a rundown white trash neighborhood and a house that is falling apart. She has at least 10 cats and 5 dogs, none of which are treated for flee slash takes or fed well even though she claims to be rescuing them. She smokes and vapes constantly. To the point of my asthma cloud of cigarettes smoke follows her everywhere, and we are all convinced she is still doing some assortment of drugs based on her behavior, power and general lack of money. Our mom has had to pay bills for her and I'm not convinced Ruth pays her back despite my mom claiming she does eventually. Ruth has always been attention seeking. When my wife and I got engaged, Ruth was suddenly announcing her engagement to her husband. She planned her wedding to be in our grandparents backyard on their wedding anniversaries and homage to them. When my wife and I bought our house, Ruth jumped the gun and bought a single white trailer to put on a piece of land her husband owns. It was radian rundown, was yellowed inside from cigarette smoke, and there was gunshot holes in some of the mirror pains in the house. She has a habit of putting lipstick on a pick, as the saying goes, so claimed it had great bones and she could fix it. Now, my wife and I just succeeded in getting pregnant from IVF. It took a long time and a lot of medical visits, but it took an I am 4.5 meters along, as fate would have it.","Poster, Toy, Cake, Human face, Human hand, Food wife, car, 0 998,023, @ppo pregnant?, cigarette, options, 4, oscodd©, CTiTok, we, succeeded, cause, estate, times, feet, d TikTok, Tiklo, paying, @Anonymous, @ppop3617, constantly, TikTOk, garette, D, husband, oTikTok, to, 2, even, @pposse, been, 419gdodd@, blame, her, C TikTok, got, @ppop361, apart, the, O TiKTOk, ppOR 5617, vearious, so, always, TikTok, d nkiok, JT, eventually, TiTOK, yellowed, bafled, from, pigs, graduated, power, AlAr for being upset my sister is, nouncing, Ru, nefther, Tiklok, dTTO, is, C Tikok, C TiKTOK, som, keep, TikTOK, them, convinced, things, 998,023, @ppops61, o TikTok, claiming, P, TkTok, a, for, dter, p36, op3617, Uipstick, drugs, seeking, dTikTok, she, jobs, school, ppop3617, treated, house, OP, i, TiKTOk, C, CTiKTOK, @pp003617, @ppop3t, I, despite, TiKTOK, mom, AlTAr for being upset my sister is, choices, and, upset, Ruth, divorced, Stids, o, lets, of, S, 83, dogs, Tikok, 2999+ 999+, both, backyard, d, TIKTOK, @ppopse1, C TIKTOK, wants, that, which, education, TKTOK, CTikTok, anniversarie, bones"

I'm sorry, but this is not supportive of women. This is not women supporting women. This is like trashing me for craving a decaffeinated coffee. And then they proceeded to say that American doctors are the only ones saying that we should be allowed to have a certain amount of caffeine every day while pregnant. But if my doctor clears me and I'm healthy and my baby's healthy and we have no issues, I'm getting a regular medium-sized coffee once a week. I think that's okay.

7322531886763445547,Replying to @blkdanielle there are many options that don't involve eating or #smoking! #hyperemesisgravidarum #pregnancy ," Product considerations during pregnancy part two, check part one for my thoughts on edibles. CBD A is a fantastic cannabinoid for nausea and this is usually available in tinctures or capsules. The HG moms that I've worked with, CBD A hasn't really done that effective. Most of them need good old THC. Lots of moms choose to smoke, but if we want to limit the toxins that come along with smoking, then let's take a look at dry herb vaporizing. Dry herb vaporizers are a fantastic way to inhale heated plant that's not combustion. And you get that immediate relief and the benefits of the terpies because they mostly don't burn off. I'm not a huge fan of regular use of concentrates outside of pregnancy and definitely feel the same way during pregnancy. Another fantastic option is a transdermal patch. This is a patch that goes on your wrist like this and can deliver the medicine directly to your bloodstream. This is great for people who don't like edibles or tinctures or don't like to inhale. These are hard to find, but a great option for the HG moms who need that continuous infusion of the medicine.",

Most couples were required to follow special preconception rituals, for example, involving eating specific foods for a specific time frame before they were allowed to marry and try to conceive. * This was all in an effort to: * 🌻 Increase fertility of mom and dad 🌻 Support mom’s health during pregnancy 🌻 Support optimal health and development of baby 🌻 Ensure survival of mom and baby postpartum 🌻 Ensure survival of the next child * How we go into pregnancy can not only influence how our ability to get pregnant, but also: * ✨ How easy our actual pregnancy is ✨ How easy our delivery is ✨ How easy our postpartum is ✨ And most importantly, how healthy our baby is * Of course, there will always be situations out of our control. But the more we can prepare, the better foot we can put forward as we step into this amazing journey. There is actually so much more you can do to enter pregnancy the best version of yourself.

7314112380135443758,#tooltips #reddit #tooltiktok #redditstories #scary #askreddit ," Dad neglected me for his narcissistic wife who wants to get rid of me. Now that they have a son they want me to move out. My dad and my mom separated a long time ago because my mom messed around a lot with substances. Her pregnancy was very high risk because she found it really hard to quit smoking and drinking. My dad made her quick cold turkey, but he would always find her with a drink in hand. I didn't suffer a lot for it, but it definitely messed me up. When my mom gave birth, my dad went through with a divorce and got full custody of me. Since it was just us for a long time, I got very used to his presence and being the only girl in his life. He was a very busy man but he always made time to watch movies with me, take me on vacation out of state, we even went to Disney World once. It was amazing with it just being the two of us. But then Nina came into the picture. Nina was my dad's wife whom he married five years ago. I'll admit I didn't like her. She stole my dad away all the time. She would constantly want to go on dates with him so I had to stay with a babysitter or by myself when I got older. It got really lonely and I missed spending time with my dad. It seemed like Nina had it out for me and wanted him to start a new life with him and without me. She never even tried to bond with me. My dad would push for us to do girly things together, but Nina would always say she's too tired or say she already had plans. I got the hint and stopped involving myself with her. Because of this distance between us, my dad started to forget I existed. He would make dinner for the two of us and he got into the habit of only making portions for two. This meant that whenever he cooked, I would have to eat some leftovers or heat up some frozen food because Nina would always eat all of it. I've tried to talk to my dad about it, but he says I'm young and still trying to adjust to this life. I told him it's been five years already, I should be used to it by now, but things only. Get worse because Nina hates me. He tried to tell me that Nina was also struggling toa adjust to having a daughter so I should cut her some slack.

I'm going to go first and say it's never a good idea to be a smoker and feed your baby from your body, but it's also never a good idea to be a smoker and not feed your baby from your body. The challenge is it will be on your skin, it will be in your hair, even when you shower, it off gases and your baby will be exposed to it.

So we're basically halfway down with this pregnancy since we will not be going past 39 weeks with this baby. So I feel like we are in the home stretch. We have an update on the Unisom situation and Don't quote me on this, but I did a lot of research online and So many moms said that they needed to wean themselves off of Unisom. Technically, it says that you can cut quit cold turkey But so many moms had these adverse reactions where they were like Violet sick when they would just quit cold turkey and so I have been taking like the smallest little Like bite out of these tiny little pills for the last week and I haven't been groggy and I haven't been sick And so I'm hoping in the next like week or so. I'll be completely done with Unisom and I've been feeling a thousand times better I think the other thing that's in helping a lot is that I've been working out I think like the endorphins are making me feel a lot better. This is a very very random side note This is like the best dress ever. I have it in two other colors But again, I asked about this stripe one all the time dress and lala just released this cut in smaller stripes today and it's so cute I definitely don't be getting it and it's like the cutest maternity pregnancy outfit It's lightweight. It's so cozy. I Live in these dresses. We have another anatomy scan next week I can feel a baby girl like swimming inside me all day long It's the best thing ever. I feel like as it used my anxiety So much. I don't use the Doppler really anymore and I can just like Feeler whenever I'm feeling anxious this week. I feel good the only Sundan that sucks is my sleep is starting to like really suck Which comes with the territory is totally fine. I just thought I was gonna have a couple more weeks And I don't think that that's the case. So that's all right. I'm really stressed The jet lag in Paris and not having a pregnancy pillow with me And my sleep situation and I won't be taking a exam at that point. So We'll see, but it'll be worth it to see Harry",

7130704937385905454,"@awerkingmama “Let’s encourage your body to go into labor.  Allow spontaneous labor rather than medical induction for the best #laboranddelivery possible. I’m not saying that being induced is bad but what I am saying is that we should try our best to avoid disrupting this natural process.  That being said, I know many of you who are 36+ weeks are probably feeling OVER IT. Trust me, I was just there.  Here are some of my favorite ways to prepare your body for labor and potentially induce labor:  1️⃣ Oxytocin/Sex: #oxytocin is the love ❤️ hormone and is how labor begins and progresses. This can happen through physical touch, feel good things, kissing, sex and nipple stimulation. Not only that, sperm contains the only natural #prostaglandin which helps our cervix soften for labor.  2️⃣ Induction Massage/Acupressure Points: Did you know there were #acupressure points that could induce labor in your body? Having an induction massage scheduled for your due date or after could help your body naturally go into labor!  3️⃣ Exercise: Yes - get up and move! Exercise and movements that will open up the pelvis and help baby engage could encourage baby to come sooner. Squats, lunging and walking are all great options.  4️⃣ Miles Circuit/Curb Walking: Want to help baby engage in the proper position? The Miles Circuit and curb walking can help baby engage into the pelvis or help encourage baby to get into an optimal position for labor.  5️⃣ Nipple Stimulation: Pumping or manual stimulation can be very effective in inducing labor. It can help your body release oxytocin and help your uterus begin contractions.  6️⃣ Birth Tinctures/Red Raspberry Leaf Tea: I swear by these. You can drink RRL throughout your pregnancy and start your tincture around 35/36 weeks. They’ve been said to help shorten labor as well.  *Always discuss with your provider before beginning anything new.  Keep in mind that this process takes time and while you may not see the immediate effects, it’s doing it’s job and your body will respond when it’s ready.  Release control and stress.

7150634420318457134,"So if you see a mama smokin while shes pregnant, the doctors more than likely know she is and theyre taking extra precaution with that baby 🤍 no judging "," Okay, I know our generation really don't like kids. Really don't want kids. But I feel like the main reason a lot of us don't want kids is the responsibility of the money. But also because you have to stop doing drugs. No one wants to stop doing that. No one wants to stop hitting Nick either. No bitch that is going to get pregnant is going to be excited. But here's one thing that our generation doesn't know and that I learned when I was young just by coincidence. If you smoke cigarettes or if you smoke weed, and you had been doing it for a long time and then got pregnant, they say it's easier for you to just keep smoking through the pregnancy rather than being pregnant and going through withdrawal because your baby will go through that too. So if you smoke cigarettes or you smoke a lot of weed, they're just going to tell you to microdose it. Not completely stop. Just in case you didn't know. My aunt got pregnant and she was a big smoker. And she thought they were going to make her stop and they were like, no you can't. Like it'll just be easier if you keep doing it just microdose.",

7280529573769415979,Replying to @chloeoleyoleyo #powerofprayer @✨Jersey_ Mama_Recovery✨ @Leah Kane 👸 ," Chloe. Okay, Chloe. So I just want to say this, right? You've been in the same position, right? You fucked around, you was getting high and stuff like that, right? And you was able to stop once you've got pregnant. By the grace of God, right? By the grace of God. Okay? You could be humble and try to understand why women continue to use during pregnancy because you've been there just because you was you stopped me. Find out it doesn't matter. Doesn't define the person. There's a lot of reasons why women do not just stop. They code turkey. They will lose their child just like me. I code turkey in my water, bro. I had blood and everything in question out of me. Okay? I finally get to the hospital and bump in the ambulance more and would just crush out of me. I'm praying begging, God, please don't take my baby away from me. Now my other children, my addiction got so bad that I signed up my rights over. Two of them I signed my rights over. One of them I was so broken in my addiction. I did not fight for him. And I'm sure you're going to have a lot to say about that, right? My first three pregnancies. I was able to quit. My third pregnancy though. I was on sub-utax, but I was abusing it. I was selling and snorting it, right? But I thought it was better than anything else. And gratefully my son was born with no withdrawals. But we get to my fourth pregnancy. My miracle baby that almost lost right because code turkey quitting. Okay? Greatfully. God let me keep her. Greatfully matter of fact. My water broke and all that was gushing out of me through the ambulance to the hospital. Being not able to stay coherent or awake because I lost so much fluid and blood. When I was able to open my eyes for a few seconds, they gave me an ultrasound. And I see my baby's heart. She was there. She was okay. So, and I went right back out of it. You know what I mean? There's a lot of, did you just hear what I said? Because I code turkey quit. I almost lost my child. She's a strong one though. Like the doctor said, she still have her own sack. She's a mechanic. That's exactly what they said. So, I don't think you should judge. You know what the lady in the video or my friend Christina, there is lying. There is reason to everything. Just like she checked into a six month rehab, I checked into a rehab to where you could stay for a year. And I would stay for a little over four months. Okay? And I was able to get, get into recovery. A lot of women don't have that and they're judged. They're treated so horribly. They could go to the hospital and ask for help go anywhere. And people judge them and turn their cheek on them. And that's exactly what you did. You're not better than anybody.","Human face, Woman, Clothing, Girl, Glasses, Person 2, 10), comment, G, I, Tik Tok, J, to ""get clean"" if she, the first place, 11, never used drugs, Reply to chloeoleyoleyo's, o, 11210), 117, F, dTkTok, kTok, o TikTok, 23, CTIKTOK, ikTok, P, 1110), @sobermommarobin, Ge, a, Wouldn't have had, S, C TiTok, d TikTok, @sobermommar, -, CTiKTOk, TikTok, Gr, d, while pregnant in, cTikTok, dTikTok, o likTok, 101, II, 1, 1o, bain, D, 11710), 10"

7285357810186079530,," You know, just briefly, the inappropriate behaviour that Boba engaged in, apparently involved her being loud and refusing to stop vaping around a pregnant woman. Also, there was some fondling and light over the pants handstock which was caught on video. But again, I don't want to get into that too much, because in Italy, markets are dubious. That Maloney will be able to. It was Beetlejuice, by the way. That was the musical. Lauren Bogart was watching. It was a touring production of Beetlejuice The Musical. I just need you to know that. I'm not saying it'd be appropriate to engage in high school freshmen ear-a-hand stuff during a production of any musical, but I just wanted to be absolutely clear that this wasn't one of the more explicitly sexual ones, like spring awakening or rocky horror or cats. This was Beetlejuice. I show this quite loudly about death. I'm just saying, if you get your nipples tweaked and your pipes squeaked, you save that shit for Fiddler like a god damn adult. But again, it's an old story. It's been resolved. And it fundamentally doesn't matter. What matters is, in Italy, economic growth rates are causing some significant... Sorry, that it's just one more thing about Lauren Bogart. Reports say that after receiving a warning at intermission, the final complaint that letter to be kicked out came five minutes into act two. Now, if you don't know the show, that put us comfortably into that beautiful sound, a song where Beetlejuice and Lydia are gleefully taught to a series of visitors, including a Girl Scout, a Peter delivery person, and one of their neighbours. It's a song about how they like the sound of tortured screams. Is it the least sexy thing a person can sit through? No, that would be this, but it is up there. Anyway, as you've been escorted out of the theatre, she apparently said, do you know who I am? And I will be contacting the Mayor. Would you two just catastrophically bad decisions? If you've been caught for again, sexual activity during Beetlejuice, the musical, you would hope no one knew who you were and you definitely wouldn't want to immediately get on the phone with the Mayor to tell him what had just happened. And the thing is, sadly, this incident has now derailed me so much, I don't even have time to talk about it at least, economic struggles anymore. So, much like Lauren Bogart and the musical Beetlejuice, you'll never get to know how it all turns out.","Suit, Tie, Human face, Woman, Clothing, Man, Footwear, Glasses, Person , . . . . ., PROOF, BBPOLBJUFCE, contacting the mayor' ..."", am' and I will be, 2023, am' and 'I will be, am' and ' will be, ing lot, SEPTEMBER 14, BEKY, THE DENVER POST, MISICAL, ITALY, after 'causing a disturbance', d TikTok, pregnant woman."", BOPOLBJUTOC, N, c TikTok, . . . . .he, SPRING AWAKENING, ..

Basically, vapes are literally making people stupid 🤪 - The flavours they use have some of the same chemicals found in exhaust fumes There will be other stuff we simply don’t know about yet. Yes, we don’t have 20-30 year studies on vapes yet, but common sense should prevail here.  We really don’t need to be waiting for the same pattern to play out that happened with cigarettes … surely we’re smarter than that?!  Personally I don’t take risks on things because “the science hasn’t been proven yet” - my intuition already knows. It’s not that the science hasn’t been proven, it’s that the science hasn’t caught up and it’s in no one’s interest to conduct these studies. We are guinea pigs for consumerism and addiction.  And please, if you do decide you’re going to continue, please don’t do it around your kids or teens, and especially not when you’re pregnant or breastfeeding.  All our actions have implications. LV♾️ . . . . . . #holisticwellnesscoach #holisticlifecoach #vaping #naturalliving "," Whether or not you like vapes or you smoke one, common sense would tell us that they're probably not good for us We were told cigarettes were good for us and then we were told well, they won't harm you and people chose to believe it for a long time Why would anyone not look at history and know that it is literally repeating itself right now? Vapes are damaging your health in a huge way and if you're choosing to smoke one you are asking for health problems down the line Yes, of course we don't have conclusive 20 to 30 years studies on this but come on Do we really need to wait for science to prove something before we make good choices? So what are vapes doing to us? Well, they coat the lungs in harmful chemicals that can eventually lead to cancers They disrupt lung function and in the shorter term concourse bronchiolitis and interestingly the chemicals in vapes Also actually reduce co-blinative function in how they impact the brains The flavors that they use have some of the same chemicals found in exhaust fumes So generally they are a precursor to disease and in my opinion no healthier than smoking for a day Please don't smoke these in front of your kids or allow your teens to smoke them and really try and make a choice to get it up There's no doubt that vapes will be a contributing factor in the diseases that you're genetically predisposed to that can be avoided With the right lifestyle it is or a choice",

This is specifically for the 20-year-old who keeps bashing you because they clearly have never been pregnant and they clearly don't do their research beyond what they see on TV and what they feel like watching and researching. Scholar.google.com is much more reliable than Google.com. Have them type in nicotine pregnancy in. Third one down is particularly my favorite. I'm going to show you a paragraph from that. Everybody pause and read before we continue to bash the pregnant mother who is trying. When my eldest was born prematurely, she was right next to a little beautiful little girl who was addicted to crack and her mother still didn't want to quit. They know what tends to quit. And I still think about Molly Skye out of the Albany Nikki every day wondering if she's okay.

7280194818347732270,"correction, i started when i was 17 and im now 24 🥴🥴 heres to the last time i do this #quitvaping"," I wanted to talk about my third experience quitting nicotine cold turkey. Third time, yeah. So I'm gonna make sure that my third time quitting vaping and quitting nicotine in general is gonna be the last time that I do this because it's not fun and it's terrible. I quit nicotine two other times from now and it was all for like long periods of time like maybe like a year. The reasons that made me start nicotine or like using vapes again were instances where something terrible happened and I was so upset that I was like screw it, I don't even care. Whoever has a vape in the close vicinity to me give it to me or I'm gonna bitch fit. So yeah like bad things happening that really upset me. Two would be when I'm drinking, when I'm drunk, all defenses are down. I feel like I can't have like that good drunk and keep in mind I'm not an alcoholic. I don't really drink that much but it's like these special occasions where I want to have a fun night and I want to feel good with all my friends. Oh my god and like if there's anyone vaping around me, I want it so bad I could cry and it's like I don't have that like feel good experience until I've hit the vape and then I'm like oh what a good night you know. Yeah so bad things happening. Drinking like social, oh my god social occasions I guess going out and drinking would be one of them but like social occasions in general. It could be a birthday party, it could be a wedding, it could be a lunch with family and all I want and all I can think about the entire time is the next time I can go to the bathroom and I can hit my vape. I don't know why. But those are all things that have made me start again and I have probably been vaping since like on and off since I was 17 and I started because I had like such a short temper and anytime I would hit a vape it was like it completely just calmed my entire body and made me very apathetic towards the situation. It didn't make me feel better but I just felt like I didn't care anymore. So on to why I quit called Turkey rather than like taking slow steps to wean myself off of the amount of nicotine because I was vaping a lot. I mean the first thing I would do in the morning was vape. The first thing or the last thing I would do in the day was vape. So and then after every meal after every snack it was like it felt gross to me. I mean vaping got to the point like I felt so bad about it that I was doing it so much that I would gag after hitting the vape just because I knew I felt gross. I knew I did. But in the past I've tried to like wean myself off and lower the amount that I was smoking in a day by just not having my own vape because I would always have friends around me or my fiance around me who had a vape and I knew that I could ask them if I could hit theirs and I thought the fact of like me constantly having to ask to use their vape and feeling bad about that would make me vape less but really just drove me crazy and it was a very miserable experience and I just felt like a moocher and really uncomfortable the entire time. And this time I waited until I knew I had like four days off in a row to just like you know what I'm done. Taylor my fiance I'm sorry but I'm gonna be pretty terrible in the next few days and luckily he's amazing so he's so supportive every time I've done this god and this will be the last time so thanks baby. But what helps me with cravings I'm sorry this has taken so long. What helps me is outtoids and then drinking ice cold water. It almost hurts but god it's like this like cooling feeling from my mouth to my throat all through my chest like it just gives me that same cooling feeling to calm myself down. Ice water in general I know that's like not too good for you I've learned that ice water isn't awesome for your body but I'm gonna ignore that. I also I'm a server I work in the food industry which is terrible and everyone has vapes there too and I have worked at so many restaurants that are just so used to like vaping and people going on smoke breaks that it was still available to me and those like six hour sometimes nine hour shifts so like I still allow myself to go on a little break but obviously don't have nicotine with me so like if I'm having a terrible night or a little terrible moment those happen a lot in the food industry so I'll still walk out to where I used to go to hit my vape and I'll just take deep breaths until quite literally I'm dizzy. I promise you it like it helps it helps it really does. So like still allow yourself that time to go take a mental break just without smoking. Also 80% of the time because I'm three weeks in now 80% of the time I am so happy that I have quit and that's 20% of the time it is when I have social anxiety it is when I had a bad day and that's it that's the only time that I'm like God like I really miss that I really miss that other than that I feel so good and it really is true the amount of people that I've seen in other TikToks that say that their breathing is better honestly I have a lot of anxiety already so my breathing's always been very like heavy at moments but it's like this entire part of my chest feels lighter than it did before it feels clear and that helps with the anxiety already had about vaping I had anxiety so I veiled and then I was vaping and I gave my anxiety it's so good for me. Also I'm so mad I didn't do like a day one quitting the vape and I didn't do that because one every time I quit I've been a terrible person for three days three whole days so mean so short tempered and I was also scared of doing a day one like quitting the vape for the third time because I was so prepared to quit trying like I was so prepared like you know what something's gonna happen and I'm gonna go buy a vape and then I'm gonna be embarrassed that I posted that in the first place and I have to delete it so now three weeks in and baby it's sticking it is sticking and I don't read it at all and I really want everyone else to quit because like as a kid we were taught don't smoke cigarettes don't smoke cigarettes this is what your lungs are gonna look like this is disgusting you won't be able to taste right your breath will smell bad and yeah I was like oh absolutely not I'm never touching cigarette and then vapes came out I was like well it's just flavored air what's wrong with that and here we are I did it on and off for six years and what makes it worse is like we know what cigarettes and tobacco and nicotine does for our bodies we have no idea what these hot chemicals coming out of vapes due to our lungs and what it will what life will be like when we're older and I'm trying to get old I don't want to die young and I especially don't want to live a life where breathing takes like labored effort that freaks me out and is one of the things that freaked me out the most and made me feel so gross about myself because I was vaping I also saw I think it was a Facebook post or something of someone saying like to people who vape I don't want to smell your baby back rib centen or flavored vapes and then why literally made me feel so grossed out and embarrassed because like honestly when there's like a slightly burnt vape that you were hitting that's it babe and I never I never put it together but that's actually disgusting and I used to hit burnt vapes because I didn't want to buy a new one and it now it's like no awful but I'm sorry this is nine minutes but whoever's trying to quit it is worth it keep going and whoever judges you for wanting to quit and the way you act when you're trying to get through something that's so so hard then they don't need to be around you babe they don't.","Human face, Clothing, Woman, Girl don't smoke cigarettes, but like social occasions in, this is what your lungs are, and then I'm like oh, Turkey, time and um, it was a Facebook post or, my fiance I'm sorry, or I'm gonna pitch fit, most, my vape, what a good night, my own vape, in a day by just not having, same cooling feeling to, cause I was vaping a lot, baby back rib, I mean vaping got to the, doing a day one, a little break, cause like honestly, d TiKTOk, anxiety, and I was like, and like if there's anyone, c TikTok, vitting, me start nicotine or like, wean myself off, um I'm sorry, and I was so upset that I, just calmed my entire, situation, but what helps me with, like labored effort, I also I'm a server, or my fiance around me, and I thought the fact of, long periods of time, Tik Tok, my mouth to my throat, and what makes it worse, and embarrassed, C TikTok, vaping around me, was smoking um, anxiety already, heavy at moments um, and tobacco, body, is the next time I can go to, it's sticking, quitting, I knew that I could ask, much, that's the only time that, many restaurants that are, but really just drove me, I'm never touching, we have no idea what, 80% of the time, I promise you it like, so like if I'm having a, cause I didn't wanna buy a, and I have worked at so, nicotine with me, P, and here we are, um, amount of nicotine, keep going um, to people who vape, that's it babe, so much that I would gag, I don't wanna die young, I also saw I think, with all my friends, that really upset me, and it gave me anxiety, but I just felt like I didn't, when you're trying to get, and it really is true, rather than like, give it to me, uncomfortable the entire, last time that I do this, I don't really drink that, all through my chest, chest feels lighter than it, mental break, I work in the food industry, so now I'm three weeks in, not to delete it, and um all I want, it's like this, and, to like still allow yourself, terrible night or little, but it's like the special, no awful but, this entire part of my, 3rd time quitting Vapi, so mean um so short, the the the it was like, food industry, days and um, it really does, that freaked me out the, people going on smoke, didn't make me feel better, had like, and that's it, but it's like, and it's like, such a short temper, tempered, and then I'm gonna be, um ice water in general, your breath will smell bad, cigarette, third time yeah um, off in a row um, I've Learned that ice water, knew I had like four days, E, 3rd time quitting Var, like I really miss that, due to our lungs, like, itting, d TikTok, |, that good drunk, and it was a very, would be one of them, third experience quitting, and I just felt like a, luckily he's amazing so um, sometimes nine hour, I've tried to like, it is worth it, just because I knew it, 3 weeks + 2 days in of, going out and drinking, care anymore, made me feel so grossed, does to our bodies, Jitting, just without smoking also, like it just gives me that, 3rd time quitting Vapil, 3rd time quitting \, other than that, I've probably been vaping, so hard then, I was smoking um, vapes, also I'm so mad I didn't do, it could be a birthday, it is sticking, and I never I never, for um, and then after every meal, o TikTOk, nicotine cold Turkey, gonna look like, three whole days, me constantly having to, I've hit the vape, it helps it helps, that say that their, 3rd time quitting Vapin, that in the first place, apir, vaping, I'm done um Taylor, I felt so bad, there too, so on to why I quit cold, terrible moment, but those are all things, o TikTok, happening um, va, all defenses are down, taking slow steps to um, and I started because I, you won't be able to taste, moocher and really, and this will be the last, 3rd time quit, that helps with the anxiety, because one, first thing or last thing I, so um bad things, like maybe like a year, through something that's, 80% of the time cause I'm, but I'm gonna be pretty, when I'm drunk um, ice cold water, embarrassed that I posted, they don't need to be, it was like it completely, and those like six hour, party, I, J, apathetic towards the, 17, screw it I even care, since uh, have a fun night, to just like, but in the past, and nicotine, and I did it on and off for, C TIKTOK, I am so happy that I have, wanting to quit, is like, so my breathing's always, and that 20% of the time, these hot chemicals, J., vape so, is so good for me, would do in the morning, scented or flavored vapes, after every snack, but I'm gonna ignore that, and I can hit my vape, long, them if I could hit theirs, ting, vape, friends around me, Tik TOk, social occasions I guess, C TiKTOk, would do in the day was, crazy, and all I can think about, point like, I know that's like, bad things happening uh, someone saying like, um trying like, I'm sorry this is taking so, close vicinity to me, using vapes again, was vape, feel good experience until, and now it's like, um very like, cause it's not fun and it's, the bathroom, breathing is better, 3rd time quitting V, we know what cigarettes, like cooling feeling from, 3rd time quitti, been, time, he's so supportive every, 3rd time quitting Va, um and I didn't do that, it's just flavored air, d TikTOk, coming out of vapes, vape that you were hitting, C TikTOk, and I'll just take deep, I was so prepared like oh, time I've done this god, new one, gross about myself, and I was also scared of, so I'm gonna make sure, occasions where I wanna, um and I especially don't, quite literally I am dizzy, @celinahazelton, like on and off since I was, what's wrong with that um, I was like well, I knew I felt gross, did before, want to live a life where, something terrible, as a kid we were taught, it was the the, it could be um, something's gonna, I'm not an alcoholic, that my third time quitting, 3rd time quitting Vapir, vaping and um, a lunch with family, miserable experience, right, you know yeah, but obviously I don't have, honestly I have a lot of, and lower the amount that, but that's actually, and is one of the things, and made me very, terrible in the next few, and anytime I would hit a, out, that freaks me out, around you, happen, happened, S, cause I would always have, the entire time, it could be a wedding, because I was vaping, were instances where, just so used to like, general, isn't awesome um, whoever has a vape in the, it feels clear and um, I'm drinking, and I'm trying to get old, no, other times from now, and I used to hit burnt, who had a vape and um, I still allow myself to go on, and what it will, and everyone has vapes, where I used to go to hit, it is when I had a bad day, I feel like I can't have like, everyone else to quit, but whoever's trying to, I mean uh first thing I, 3rd time quitting, ], I don't wanna smell your, I really miss that, was like, shifts so like um, Vapin, the amount of people that, babe they don't, I feel so good, ask to use their vape and, um and then vapes came, um six years, I don't know why, we're older, and I really want, um the reasons

I've had a few people asking first how do you identify it? Well second hand smoke is what you can see people expelling. So when you walk through a cloud after someone has has exhaled after they've had a cigarette or been vaping, then that's you being exposed to the second hand smoke. Third hand smoke is more subtle. It's what lands on our clothes in our hair, on our faces everywhere, everywhere. Generally speaking you can smell it although with vapor you can't smell it all the time or it doesn't smell like a toxin but it is still dangerous. If someone's in a room and they're vaping and you walk into the room even after the cloud has dissipated but you hug them or you touch them or you do anything with them then they're being exposed. You are being exposed to third hand smoke and babies don't have the ability to get up and walk away. They don't have the ability to do anything for themselves and so if your friends and family are coming over and they're saying they're just vaping it's not a big deal to do that in the house it's not gonna hurt anybody. Yes it is it's just like them having a cigarette in the house. All of that is equally dangerous and if they don't like that well this is your baby you get to write the rules and if they don't like it then that's their problem not yours.","Human face, Woman, Sunglasses, Glasses @babyreadylgbtq, FEW PEOPLE, CIGARETTE, ALTHOUGH, DISSIPATED, 7, DO YOU IDENTIFY?, YOU CAN, SO WHEN, THEY'RE, SAYING, CAN'T SMELL, EXPELLING., AFTER THEY'VE, EVERYWHERE., THEY DON'T, d TikTok, GENERALLY, SEE PEOPLE, TO, WALK INTO, AND SO IF, YOUR FRIENDS AND, IN, pod, WRITE THE RULES., CLOUD, EVEN, FAMILY ARE, THEIR, AND IF THEY, SMOKE IS MORE, ON, VAPING, TikTOk, YOU'RE YOU ARE, VAPOR YOU, YOU GET TO, HAD A, SMELL IT, WELL, ROOM AND, HAVE THE ABILITY, YOU'RE, CLOUD HAS, IT'S NOT A, A CIGARETTE, I WANT TO, TOXIN., TOUCH THEM OR, ANYTHING, d TikTOk, WITH, WHAT, THEN THAT'S, DON'T LIKE IT THEN, SOMEONE'S, TikTok, o TikTOk, CLOTHES, WALK AWAY., PROBLEN, AND BABIES, LIKE A, SMOKE IS, EXPOSED, THAT'S, SMOKE, ALL OF, EXHALED, AND IF, thwal, OR YOU, BUT IT IS, DON'T HAVE THE, hand smoke/vapour, HAIR, THEMSELVES., YOU BEING, EVEN AFTER THE, GET, NOT YOURS, AND YOU, OR BEEN, IF, LANDS, DON'T, THE, HAND, OUR, IT'S WHAT, IT'S, o TikTok, IT, FIRST HOW, BIG DEAL TO DO, P, a, CLOTHES,, -, THE ROOM, LIKE THEM HAVING, WELL THIS, IS EQUALLY, BIT, YOU WALK, AFTER, LANDS ON OUR, THIRDHAND, SOMEONE'S IN A, SECOND, STILL DANGEROUS., I'VE HAD A, BEING, GOINGTO, TO DO, COMING, IT ALL THE TIME, SOMEONE, MORE, FREQUENTLY, I, YOUR FRIENDS, ABOUT, ALL OF THAT, SMELL, J, THROUGH A, YES, and, SPEAKING YOU CAN, IT'S JUST, VAPING., pri, EXPOSED TO, YOU, @babyreadylghtq, of, S, Dangers of 2nd & 3rd, THEM THEN, BECAUSE IT'S, SECOND HAND, YOU DO, RECENTLY., BUT YOU, IT'S NOT, ASKING., UP AND, IT DOESN'T, 1, TO THIRD, FOR, TOUCH BASE AGAIN, SMOKE., ABILITY TO, IT ALL THE TIME OR, DON'T LIKE THAT, COME UP A"

7224175927293496618,Replying to @outoftheashe , You understand that that's super condescending right? Like thanks for your pity I guess but like what dude? Are you aware by chance that quitting smoking cigarettes has the same withdrawal effects on your fetus as quitting opiates? Like quitting cold turkey could just kill my baby. And just like people on opiates get maintenance medication to help them taper down so their baby doesn't die. The same goes for cigarettes. You're supposed to taper yourself down instead of just quitting cold turkey. So I went from smoking like a pack and a half a day to now I smoke a pack every like two to three days and I'm continuing to taper down from there. So I'm not ashamed I'm doing what I can to fix the situation. And for the record I did try to quit smoking before I got pregnant. I was vaping and cutting down my nicotine content or whatever but then I fucking ran out of pods and couldn't find them again. So I went back to cigarettes and then I got pregnant and was like well fuck and baby super healthy so far so.,

First, make sure you have a smoking shirt. Keep your shirt outside and after you quit smoking go ahead and take that shirt off before you come back in the house. It contains one of those things that likes to stick to our skin. So every place that was exposed you want to wash with soap and water before you hold your baby. Try to cut back smoking more than 10 cigarettes a day is going to affect your supply. You evaluate why you're smoking. Lots of times it's a stress reliever, finds out that you might be able to replace that with. That's a little bit more healthy and will give you more time with your baby.","Lamp, Shirt, Human face, Woman, Clothing, Dress I, SCLC, IBCLC, J, C TikTok, --, 5, =, o TikTok, a, S, -, d TikTok, breastfeeding, TikTok, - -, - - -, ---, c TikTok, Cig smoking &, @lactationuniversity"

7296995762993433886,Come along with me as i quit nic for good (hopefully)#greenscreenvideo #quittingnic #quittingnicjourney #vape #accountability #quittingnicforgood #nicotinefein #nicotinewithdrawls ," I am coming on here for accountability because I want to be judged if I don't do this. Starting tomorrow I am quitting vaping and I have been a hardcore vapor for a while and before I've baked I smoke cigarettes so I have had nicotine in my system for a long time. The only time that I have ever stopped is when I was pregnant with both of my kids so I know I'm capable of doing it. It's just like getting there. I've tried multiple times and I've failed every single time. But I have to quit this time. I have to do it because I get winded when I'm walking up the stairs. I'm 25 years old and I get winded when I'm walking up the stairs. I work out every night and I have done really good. I have lost 10 pounds in like the last month. I've done super, super good at getting my health under control, eating wise, working out, trying to be healthy. This is the final step for me. Getting there is stopping this. It's to the point to where it's holding me back so much. I feel like I could work out so much better and it would be more efficient with it. If this thing, this thing right here has me in such a chokehold. It's absolutely ridiculous. My boyfriend smoked cigarettes. He quit a couple of months ago and he vapes now purely just vapes. He has one of the big mods. I have this little bit of small one and I swear to you I hit it so much more than he could even think about hitting his vape. He has done this for a long time. I know I'm going to have withdrawals and that's what freaks me out because I know that the second I start to get that headache, like I'm going to want to hit it because I know that that's what's going to stop my headache. But I can't, like I have to do it this time. So I'm going to hit this tonight and I know that this is probably a bad way of doing it, whatever. If you have something to say to me about how I could do it more efficiently, that's fine. You can say that to me but I'm probably not going to take your advice because I'm going to do it the way that I need to do it in order to quit the right way for me because I have to gradually do this. Like I'm probably going to hit it tonight and in the morning I'm going to see how long I can go without hitting it. Tomorrow is not going to be that difficult for me. Tomorrow is Friday so I'll be at work and I, the only time that I hit this throughout the day on a weekday when I'm at the office is when I'm on my lunch break. That is the only time that I, you know, can hit this. So weekdays are not going to be difficult for me probably. What's going to be difficult is the weekend because I'm sitting here all day long and I'm going to have to keep myself busy with, you know, other things to keep my mind off of it because I'm going to want to sit here and hit my vape and it's horrible. It's so horrible how much of a chokehold this thing has on me. I take that back because probably honestly I hit it the whole way to work. So like the whole time in the car I'm hitting the vape like constantly while listening to music. I'm just like vibing and like hitting the vape but that's probably going to be difficult for me. I'm probably going to have to like go to the store and get a big bag of like dumb dumbs and just, you know, eat those throughout the day to get to get by. I'm going to want to hit it in the morning. I'm going to and I'm going to do my best to not and I will update you all on how this goes for me tomorrow because, you know, I don't have a feeling, I have a feeling it's not going to go very well at all. But I'm doing it on a Friday and I'm doing it on a Friday because I only have to work on Friday so I have to make it through the day on Friday which will be fine because I feel like the first day won't be. It's near as bad as like the second and third. So hopefully by like Monday, you know, I'll probably still have withdrawal symptoms on Monday. That's how probably will when I go back to work. But I'm hoping that I can get like the worst of it out over the weekend. Probably not going to go that way. But I'm hoping that that's the way that I go. But yeah, I'm going to like fill myself tomorrow, you know, whenever I feel like I want to hit it so that I don't and so, you know, maybe I can help somebody else out that's going through this because I'm never in a million years thought when I first hit my first babe. When I first, you know, didn't leave that, that it would lead to this, that it would lead to me being. I knew it was an addictive substance, but like I don't have a super addictive personality so like I don't, I never thought that it would be like this. Like it would be this hard to quit. But I really, I don't want to quit. I don't want to, but I have to. And yeah, I mean, I, it's probably not going to go well, but we're going to try. And I had like, I had severe asthma when I was a baby, but like over the last couple of years, it's like, if I don't have my inhaler on me, it's so stupid. I will hit my vape and not be able to breathe. So then I hit my inhaler twice. And then I'll hit my vape again, like like like the vape is not the issue. That's, that's what I've been thinking. Like the vape is not the issue. I just have asthma. Like no, my asthma was not that bad until I started heavily vaping. And I know that all that shit's in my lungs. And I'm so tired of feeling like shit all the time and not being able to do simple tasks because I don't want to be winded. I'm 25 years old. 25 years old. This is the worst thing that could have hit the market. The worst thing is it tastes good. You get that oral fixation of blowing smoke. And you know, you get the nicotine high. Like when you first hit it in the morning, you get that nicotine high. And then you feel like you're going to get it all day long. And I don't, at this point, I don't get it throughout the day. I just get it in the morning when I hit it after I'm in a sleep. But this is this is the worst thing because it tastes good. Sigurettes like it's so much harder. It's so much harder to smoke a cigarette because you have to go outside because you know, if you don't smoke in your house which I never did, like you'd have to go outside and sometimes like it's cold and you don't want to go outside or like you know, you don't have, you know, a brawl and you don't want to go outside. So like, you know, that prevents you from smoking a cigarette typically. This takes no work. That's why this sucks to quit so much more than anything else because this takes absolutely no work to hit. Like you can just sit on your couch and just just hit it. Like it's that simple. Whoever invented these, fuck you. I just like desperately want to be healthy and feel good every day. Like I want to like be awake and like, you know, not feel tired all of the time and not feel like this thing is the only reason why I want to get in my car. Like I don't want to feel like that anymore. I don't want to look forward to this little piece of metal and plastic in my mouth. Like I don't want to, I don't want to be in that chokehold anymore. I'm done. So yeah. So tomorrow starting at 5am when I get up in the morning, I'm going to take you all along with me whenever I want to hit this thing and hopefully I can make it through.

7322205454820511006,THE HIDDEN DANGER OF VAPING 🚬🚬 #fyp #healthtips #wellness #healthylifestyle #health #wellnesstips #vape," So when it comes to smoking or vaping, there's the thing that's being consumed, the thing that people are trying to put in their bloodstream, nicotine, cannabis, et cetera. Aping is terrible because of the other chemicals that it delivers to the lungs. It'll be GUIN. Vaping is associated with disruptions in egg health and what they call egg quality can create certain mutations in the eggs. And serious endocranishes in women. It's a mutagen. It mutates the genes of cells. It mutates the genes of rapidly dividing cells. Most, so breast cancers, ovarian cancers, egg quality, you know, sperm are constantly turning over. So, you know, people always say, no, I've been able to time it, and I got so and so pregnant or whatever, you know, women say I have a perfectly healthy kid. That kid might have been much healthier and also the kid's not grown up yet. I can introduce me to the kid later.","Microphone, Human beard, Human face, Clothing, Man VAPING IS@shadow_david69, meni, PEOPLE, MUTATIONS IN@THE_david69, THE THING THATw_david69, AND SO PREGNANTw_david69, DELIVERS, VAPING IS TERRIBLE_david69, d TikTok, BECAUSE OF, CHEMICALS THATow_david69, SMTO, EGC QUALITY, ME, GIRS, EGG QUALITY, an, BLOODSTREAM, PUT IN THE#R adow_david69, VAPING, CREATE, THE OTHER TikTok, NICOTINE, SM78, YOU KNOW, AND SERIOBSadow_david69, DIVIDING CELSdow_david69, CALL, DIVIDING CEIGdow_david69, MOST, CERTAIN, TIME, CANCERS, SO BREASTshadow_david69, DIVIDING CEIGSdow_david69, WITH DISRUPTIONS david69, d TikTOk, WIRG, LIKE INTRODUGINGv_david69, AND SERIOUShadow_david69, TikTok, THAT KID, TURNING OVER, CONSTANTLshadow_david69, SMTD, BIRS, THAT'S, SAY, SO WHEN IT COMES, @shadow_david69, amn, AND SERIOBSdow_david69, B, THERE'S THE THING, AND WHAT THEYw_david69, ITMUTATES THElow_david69, EGG QUALITY GANow_david69, atn, CHEMICALS TRATow_david69, CANNABIS, mtnin, PEOPLE ALW@w_david69, 6, IN EGG HEALTH, ASSOCIATED, THE OTHER TiTok, o TikTok, IVAPE ALL THEdow_david69, MIGHT'VE BEENdow_david69, ENDOCRINE ISSUES, 5M78, PUT IN THEI&hadow_david69, EGG QUALITYCAN david69, OMTD, IT'S A MUTAGEN, CONSTANTLhadow_david69, MUCH HEALTHIER, UM, OVARIAN CANCERS, J, SPERM ARE TikTok, ISAYIHAVE, BEING CONSUMED, WITH DISRUPTavid69, DIVIDING CEI@Shadow_david69, EGGS, TO SMOKING OR, S, GENES, NOT GROWN UP YET, OR WHATEVER, SO OBGYN, SMTE, SO BREAST@shadow_david69, OF RAPIDLY TikTok, AND IGOT SO"

Not only was the theater bougie looking, they had a different menu than I'd seen at any other movie theater. The only downside is they are Pepsi and not Coke, but whatever. I felt like I was going to a really fancy laser tag. I don't that's the only way I can explain it. The X-Roll downers talking about drinking while you're pregnant, vaping and like all this other stuff. I did not expect to have an existential crisis at the Barbie movie, but it's okay.

7279534982475812138,Yay lgbtqia’s ❤️🥰," My first Lauren Bobert video got removed for violating community guidelines. I'm gonna keep it very clean. I think the situation with her and what happened with the live performance of Beelaljuice where she was caught on camera, you know, doing some public acts that were inappropriate with her partner. There was some inappropriate touching going on. You know around people that you know are, you know, young people. So that was inappropriate. She also was vaping in front of a pregnant woman who asked her to not vape in front of her. So here we have her Republican who claims to, you know, always be accusing LGBTQI plus people of being a threat to kids. Yet here she is being inappropriate in front of kids. Here's someone who is ardently pro-life. Yeah, here she is risking an unborn child's health with her vaping and then flipping people off in public. So Lauren Bobert, you are a perfect example of Republicans today.",

7279263521827835178,#duet with @John R #boebert ," More facts are coming out. So let's go over what we know already. Lauren Bobert attended a show of Beetlejuice to Musical in Denver. A show that is rated for children 10 years old and up. Although Congresswoman Bobert is in the process of getting a divorce, she is not divorced yet. And she attended that show with a man who was not her husband. While at the show, aside from taking videos and flash photography and acting like a jackass and disturbing the other patrons, she also was vaping, vaping in front of a pregnant woman who asked her to stop and she said no. Now, I don't know what she was vaping, but in Colorado, cannabis use is legal. Also during the show, she and her escort were fumbling each other over their clothes. He was fumbling her chest, she was fumbling his crotch. And as they're being escorted out of the theater, Congresswoman Bobert gave the middle finger to the theater. Now, correct me if I'm wrong here, but so far I have not heard a single condemnation from the pro-life crowd for someone who is vaping in front of a pregnant woman. No condemnations from the evangelical Christians about her stepping out with a man who is not her husband while she's still married. And especially no condemnation from the, we must protect children from any sexuality crowd. And she was performing sex acts in a public space where children were present. The hypocrisy is mind-numbing.",

7279578960629878062,Lauren Boebert is an embarrassment to this country and the people she represents. #embarrassing #boebertresign #beetlejuice #news #fypシ ," I am legitimately at a loss for words. As a lot of you have no doubt heard, Lauren Bovert was recently kicked out of a musical interpretation of Bealjuice. There's a kid show that kids can come and see kicked out for not only vaping in the audience, but getting full on hands on groping with the person she was with. She's rubbing his genitals, he's rubbing her breasts at a kid show. And when she was vaping, I mean a pregnant woman was sitting right behind her and asked her to please stop and she refused to do it. The only person that got kicked out of a kid show was a congresswoman. And Lauren Bovert barely won that election. And she said, I think she's like her, has no business holding a government position. Because people like her are the examples that we set when we choose to like people like this. And Colorado, you deserve better than someone like her. Because she's making, she's making your state look like an embarrassment. And right along with everyone else she represents. Because what is really sad is that, you know, the days of like John McCain and Mitt Romney, now he's on his way out like those days are gone. They're now being replaced with people like Lauren Bovert, Marjorie Taylor, Green, Ted Cruz, Matt Gates, it's an embarrassment. And of course, the right thing for Bovert to do would be to resign. But of course someone like her won't do it. Because she enjoys the title and the power too much. She doesn't care what she does. She doesn't care about the rep about who she represents. I mean, if she had a decent bone in her whole body, she would have actually been decent at a kid show and could even do that. Colorado, you deserve better. Our government deserves better. And so I just, for the district she represents, I beg you, please, for the love of God, when election time comes around again, get around the office. Fucking kid show.",

My 22 female, friend, 21 female, is convinced that she is emotionally ready for a child. She cries every time she gets a negative test or her period despite being on birth control. She wants to be pregnant and have a baby so bad but she is so extremely ill-equipped and is so much more maturing to do before she's ready. Firstly, her boyfriend of a few months isn't even ready. Secondly, she doesn't even have a job right now. She's doing interviews but hasn't actually gotten a job and it's been almost a month since she quit her last. She has three pets that she occasionally forgets about. She doesn't clean up after herself after preparing food. When she has a job, all she does is eat fast food. She vapes and drinks, which obviously you shouldn't do if you plan to become pregnant. She is emotionally unstable and struggles with communication and boundaries. And yet, she is convinced and has expressed to me on several occasions that she feels extremely ready for having a baby, not raising kids, having a baby. I've expressed that she may be severely underestimating the sacrifice and lifestyle changes. She said I've helped with my nephews before. I'm distraught at how she underestimates being solely responsible for a fragile little human. But every single time that she texts me upset because she got her period, I rejoice a little.",

Bobert was continuously vaping, talking, taking flash photography, and even groating her date. Because nothing is more romantic than getting frisky at a family-friendly music hold during a divorce that isn't finalized yet. Bobert first denied ever vaping in the theater. That is until video surveillance showed massive clouds coming straight out of her mouth. Those pencil thin lips of hers can surprisingly blow. Smoke. And her far right pro-life agenda certainly wasn't concerned with the pregnant woman's health sitting directly behind her. The Republican rep has made claims that drag shows exploit children to sexual and obscene content. Meanwhile, she chose the children's performance of Beetlejuice as a place to beat it off. And in true hypocrite fashion after shaming gay bars, she went on the date with the dude who owns one. Stumbling out of the theater in her cheap stilettos, the congresswoman gave employees the middle finger all while shouting, do you know who I am? Which we all know is something only a drunk idiot would say.",

She just kept going. Also taken flash photography. Then the man she is with, but by the way is a Democrat who owns a bar that will host drag shows, is seen groping her. Look at that, look at that, he nasty. And she's seen giving him a little bit of a hand job. This is during beetle juice. I bought my kids to beetle juice. This is a family show, but where the problem? Drag queens are the problem. Where are the groomers? Where are the ones that are having a bad influence? Look at her tweets. She is hypocrite.

Jesus came in the flesh to save you. He died and was crucified and rose again. He sits at the right hand of God the Father and the rapture is coming. It's the only thing next.

Smoking not only makes it harder for women to get pregnant, it can also cause men to lose their virility. Every time you take a drag on a cigarette, more than 5,000 chemicals are inhaled into the body. These harmful substances not only damage tooth enamel, they also damage nerve endings in the senses of smell and taste, and they damage the sillier that clean the respiratory tract, and increase the risk of lung infections. What's worse, chemicals can cause genetic mutations that make the body less resistant to cancer, and that's not all. The chemicals in cigarettes, like nicotine, in cigarettes, thicken the walls of blood vessels, platelets become sticky, which can lead to various cardiovascular diseases, although long-term smoking can seriously affect your health. But if you start quitting now, your blood pressure and heart rate will return to normal in a day, your risk of heart attack will start to drop. In two days, the nerve endings in your sense of smell and taste will start to repair themselves. If you've got a month without cracking, the health of your lungs will improve dramatically. Symptoms like coughing and shortness of breath will be relieved, but don't get too excited. The damaged hair like sillier will take at least 9 months to repair. Once the sillier return to normal, they'll be able to clean up foreign objects like dust and bacteria. If you keep it it for a year, then cardiovascular disease will gradually improve. The risk of a heart attack is cut in half. After 5 years, the chances of blood clots plummeting, the risk of stroke will continue to decrease. After 10 years, the body's ability to repair DNA is fully restored. The risk of lung cancer drops by 50 percent. After 15 years, the risk of coronary heart disease can be reduced to the same level as non-smokers. This shows that after quitting smoking, the body can regain its health, but it takes a long time, and the nicotine induced withdrawal is very painful. If you can't stand the temptation, you'll lose your life. You have to have enough self control to keep going.","Pen, Poster, Flower, Surfboard, Cake, Wall Clock, Human face, Woman, Clothing, Man, Rose, Person, Tree More than 5-000 chemicals, aday, 19, @phng.giang.hong2 smoking, After 15 years, Ninke Oxide, If you've gone a month, CKTok, 21, Tiktol, Then cardiovascular, 4, Mea dTikTok, 17 18 19 20, Lea, 5ears dkiok, Tik, sol, 8, 5Yeas dTikTok, the nerve endings in your, 7, XXX>, They'll be able to clean up, This shows that after, without cracking, bacteria., 23, cut in half, APA, relieved, And increase the risk of, temptation, er Sm, ikok, a day, 5Years JTikTok, 000, Nor, But if you start.quitting now, enamel, And they damage the cilia, d TikTok, oes the body come back, R, 9, endings, As, resistant to cancer., disease will gradually, 30, harder for women to get, -ve, .giang.hong2 smoking, Carbon Monoxide, Propdonalne, The damaged hair-like cilia, c TikTok, X 2 3 4 5 6, Eve, enzopyrene, 7 Your blood pressure and 13, ON, rate will return to normal in, X XX, It can also cause men to, relieved., same level asinon-smokers., D, More than 5:000chemicals, 2, be, 24 25 26 27, 30 31, MON, 29 29, Quinolingridine, same level as non-smokers., smoker, Tikrok, X), plummeting., Tik Tok, Although long-term smoking, Pyridin, XXX, X X, improve dramatically., Acrylonitrile, on a cigarette., Can be reduced to the, the body's ability to repair, DNAis fully restored., the chances of blood clots, cardiovascular diseases, INN NN, not only damage tooth, That make the body less, 00, 19 11 12 13, XX>, 158, disease oker, But/raldenede, C TikTok, sense of smell, But it takes a long time, Your risk of heart attack will, The risk of a heart attack is, NNN, DNA is fully restored., Smoking notonly makes i, are inhaled into the body., In cigarettes, that clean the respiratory, ?, VI, Propionaldehyde, TikTok, And that's not all., withdrawal is very painful., The chemicals in cigarettes, 16, 25 26 27, genetic mutations., E6VO, DIA, C TikTO, They also damage nerve, 15 16 19 19 20, (XXXX, er Tm, telets, vessels., and taste will start to repair, Nicotine, ome sticky, 15 16, 29, O TikTok, 28 29, The risk of stroke will, Time, Once the cilia return to, notonly damage tooth, renaldBifseccinol, er T, The risk of lung cancer, improve., But don't get too excited, health, SYs 155, (XXX, lose their virility., If you keep atitfor a year, Symptoms like coughing, Ace, Benzene, shortness of breath will be, in the senses of smell and, X, X X 3 4 56, Ne TikTok, Nar, Which can lead to various, a, 24, Sm, foreign objects like dust and, ne, taste., -, @phng.giang.hong, You have to have enough, Propior, 2-naphthyfar, Nitris&ide, In two days, And the nicotine-induced, NMik@xide, chemicals can cause, normal., the body can regain its, quitting smoking, X >, MO, start to drop., ADon M, iko, If you can't stand the, 1o, V, self-control to keep going,, Will take at least 9 months, you'll lose your life., 5Years.Tikok, @phng.giang.hong2, full, dole to health after quitting, tract., i, to repair., C, 28, d Tieto, $8 29, tiole to health after quitting, I, withdrawallis very painful., Ifyou keepatitfor a year, Afterfive years, O, oh, 15, Every time you take a drag, continue to decrease, and, er Smoker Time, Resorcinol, Quinoline Pyridine, If you've gone amonth, 22 23, o, d Tioes the body come back, can seriously affect your, Propianald, health., 22, 31, pregnant, The health of yourlungs will, The health of yourlungs wi, XX, oline, imium, These harmful substances, admium, XXXX, MONTH 1, ol, Bu, What's worse, Thicken the walls of blood, Tikok, Cadmium, Butyraldehyde, nd, eneResorcinol, themselves., ohne, ve, 0, the senses of smell and, After 10 years, like nicotine, Lead, 1, NNK and NA, Cres, Isopre, CTikTok, Propionald, drops by 50%., Phenol, More:than 5 000 chemicals, roquinone, lung infections., 10, X>, Once the cilia return tox, the risk of coronary heart, YEARS, SYS"

7312092628345081134,#movie #foryou #fyp ," Can the body fully recover and regain health after quitting smoking? Smoking not only makes it harder for women to get pregnant, it may also cause men to lose their masculinity. Every puff of smoke, more than 5,000 chemicals will be inhaled into the body. These harmful substances not only damage the enamel, they also damage the nerve endings of smell and taste, and they destroy the cilia in the respiratory tract that do the cleaning work, increasing the risk of lung infection. What's more terrifying is that chemicals can also cause gene mutations, reducing the body's resistance to cancer. Not only that, chemicals such as nicotine and cigarettes will thicken the blood vessel walls and make the platelet sticky, thus causing various cardiovascular diseases. Although long-term smoking will seriously affect health, but if you start quitting smoking now, then a day later, your blood pressure and heartbeat can return to normal values. At this time, the risk of heart attack will begin to decrease. Two days later, the nerve endings of smell and taste will begin to self-repair. If you have not smoked for a month, then the health of the lungs will significantly improve. Symptoms such as coughing and shortness of breath will be alleviated, but don't be too happy too early. The damage cilia, it takes at least 9 months to complete the repair. Once the cilia return to normal, it can enhance the ability to clean foreign objects such as dust and bacteria. If you have persisted for a year without giving up, then cardiovascular diseases will gradually improve. At this time, the risk of heart attack will be half. Five years later, the chance of thrombosis will drop rapidly. The risk of stroke will also continue to decrease. Ten years later, the body will fully recover the ability to repair DNA. The risk of lung cancer will decrease by 50%. Fifteen years later, the chance of coronary heart disease can be reduced to the same as non-smokers. It can be seen that the body can recover health after queen smoking, but it needs to go through a quite long process. And the withdrawal symptoms caused by nicotine are often painful. Once you can't resist the temptation, it is bound to fail. Must maintain enough self-control to persist.","Clock, Poster, Flower, Human face, Clothing, Woman, Food, Man, Footwear, Wall Clock, Person, Tree SYS 153, Once the cilia return to nohaikTok,

A lot of people don't know when they are ovulating. They just meet with your partner without timing it. You can time it and get it right. Yes, try to meet with your partner where you are ovulating. This is the best time not after you have ovulated. Where you are ovulating it gives you a higher chance of being pregnant. Number three, avoid stress. As a lady stress can affect your menstrual sac, which can also make it difficult for you to conceive. So try to avoid stress. You also need to quit smoking, quit drinking if you take alcohol. And also as a way for medical checkup, go with your partner. So both of you can be checked, both of you can be examined. A lot of women go to the hospital for proper examination without going with their partner. And at the end of the day it might be their partner who just be stressing themselves out. So if you are going for checkup, go with your partner. And let me add this last one. You can also ask God for what you want through prayers. So when you pray, remember what He told us, where you ask you shall receive. So pray to Him, tell Him what you want. And He's going to give you that bundle of joy that you really, really want.

7293358090487860522,"🩸🦷Gum bleeding, also known as gingival bleeding, can be caused by various factors, and it is often a sign of gum disease or other oral health issues. Here's an explanation of why gums bleed and what you can do to prevent it: 🦠Gingivitis: The most common cause of gum bleeding is gingivitis, which is an early stage of gum disease. Gingivitis occurs when plaque, a sticky film of bacteria, builds up on the teeth and irritates the gums. This can lead to inflammation, redness, and bleeding. 🪥Poor Oral Hygiene: Inadequate brushing and flossing can allow plaque to accumulate on the teeth and gums, leading to gingivitis and eventually gum bleeding. 💊Medications: Some medications, such as anticoagulants (blood thinners), can make your gums more prone to bleeding. If you're taking these medications, consult your healthcare provider about managing the side effects. 😷Medical Conditions: Certain medical conditions, such as leukemia or bleeding disorders, can make gums more susceptible to bleeding. 🤰🏽Pregnancy: Hormonal changes during pregnancy can make gums more sensitive and prone to bleeding, a condition known as pregnancy gingivitis. To prevent gum bleeding: 🪥Maintain Good Oral Hygiene: Brush your teeth at least twice a day and floss once a day to remove plaque and debris. Use a soft-bristle toothbrush and a fluoride toothpaste. Make sure to brush your gums gently. 🍎Healthy Diet: Consume a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables. Avoid excessive sugar and acidic foods, which can contribute to gum problems. 🚭Avoid Smoking: Smoking is a major risk factor for gum disease and can lead to bleeding gums. Quitting smoking can significantly improve your oral health. If your gums continue to bleed despite these preventive measures, or if the bleeding is severe and persistent, it's crucial to consult a dentist or periodontist (gum specialist) for a thorough examination and appropriate treatment. Early intervention can prevent gum disease from progressing and causing more significant oral health issues.              #DentalTips #OralHealth #DentalHealth #Tartar101 #OralCare #HealthySmile #DentalHygiene #dentist #dentalstudent #dentalassistant #dentalhygienist #dentalschool #asdohclassof2026 #gingivitis #perio #trending #viral "," Are you noticing that your gums are bleeding while brushing and flossing? Well, there's a couple of reasons that this can be happening. The first reason is due to gingivitis. Gingivitis is the accumulation of plaque, and that is going to cause your gums to become irritated. The next reason is due to poor oral hygiene. If you're not keeping up with your brushing and your flossing, well, you're asking that plaque to accumulate leading to the gingivitis. The other reason that this can be occurring is due to medications and medical conditions. Some prescription medications may just make you more prone to bleeding while brushing and flossing. Some medical conditions, like leukemia and blood disorders, may also cause you to bleed more easily within your mouth. And if these aren't the cases, it might be due to hormonal changes. So if you're pregnant or if you're going through puberty, you might also notice a change in your mouth, which may include bleeding while brushing and flossing. So what can you do if you are bleeding? Well, there's certain things, and it all depends on the reason that you're bleeding. The first thing you can do is really improve on your oral hygiene, making sure your brushing twice a day and flossing is really important. But if you don't enjoy flossing, maybe consider using a lot of pig. I use one myself. There's other ways you can improve your oral hygiene, and that can be due to diet. Avoid the sugary foods and avoid the specific foods, and you'll be off to a great start just then. And if you are a smoker or a vapor, I highly suggest that you quit doing that because that's not only impacting your overall health, it's also impacting your mouth. So if you choose to do these things, you're off to a great start to stop that bleeding from happening. But always remember, if it's getting worse or if you're having any pain in your mouth, you'll need to see your dentist or even a periodontist, the specializes in gum surgeries right away. It's important that you control this genchiditis before it can get worse and turn into periodontal disease, which is a much more severe and chronic condition that is related to genchiditis. So remember, brushing and flossing isn't just for cavities, it's also for your gums and your overall health.",

Kegel or pelvic floor exercises – It’s important to learn how to do these correctly and consistently Pelvic floor physical therapy can really help ensure these exercises are optimized and done correctly Vaginal inserts or pessaries to support the urethra Certain procedures or surgical interventions   Urge-related leaks Caused by involuntary bladder spasms aka “overactive bladder” May be larger volumes of urine Risk factors: alcohol or caffeine use, diabetes, menopause, smoking, obesity, pregnancy, urinary tract infection, certain medication, neurologic disorders What can help? Start a bladder diary noting your fluid intake, output, times, and amounts Decrease dietary bladder irritants like alcohol and caffeine Bladder retraining: go to the bathroom at set time intervals and slowly extend those intervals. If you feel an urge before that time, pause, close your eyes, take a few deep breaths in and out, and count to 10 to see if the urge will pass. Pelvic floor exercises Pelvic floor physical therapy Quit smoking Optimize control of certain health conditions like diabetes Prevent constipation Certain prescription medications   With any persistent bladder leaks, a physician can evaluate the cause and help create a treatment plan.   Urinary incontinence doesn’t have to take control of your life. While working on all the above, it’s also important to have the right protection with a pad made specifically for bladder leaks. The Poise 7 drop pad provides great protection against even large bladder leaks.   #ad #poise #bladderleaks #obgyn #healthtips #urinaryincontinence"," Here are six common causes of bladder leaks, including two you may have never thought of before So bladder leaks can be triggered by physical stress factors like coughing, Laughing, sneezing, or exercise like running or jumping But did you know that there are also different triggers of big urges to pee that can lead to leaks two? Things like pulling your car into the garage at home or Putting your hand on the door handle to the bathroom are urge-related bladder leak triggers See the caption for a few solutions, but in the meantime check out Poison's new ultra-absorbent 7-drop pads specifically designed for all day bladder leak protection",
7318306226394205483,My boyfriend accidentally slapped me. #reddit #redditstories #redditreadings #redditstorytime," My boyfriend accidentally slapped me. For a little backstory, I recently found out I'm pregnant. I found out when I was only a few weeks along and quitting drinking and smoking all of a sudden has been difficult for me. Last night, my boyfriend and I were watching TV and I was laying down, he heard something that he though was me hitting his vape. He sat up quickly and slapped me in the face. He didn't hit me hard, it was the way you might swat a child's hand when they go to touch something they shouldn't. He has a young child but doesn't hit him, I was so surprised and I just started crying. He kept apologizing over and over and trying to comfort me, saying he didn't really mean to and he thought I was hurting our baby. I'd give this as relevant or I'm just making excuses, but he has told me that his axe was abusive toward him and it's something he's sensitive about. I never thought he would put his hands on me in any way and this has never happened to me before. I feel betrayed in a way and I feel a little bit scared. I just don't know what to do, is this something people can work through? Can anyone ever really hit someone by accident? Edit, everyone's really caught up on the word accident, I was shaking as I wrote this and obviously this is coming from my POV and feelings. It's hard to remember exactly what was said in that moment I was so overwhelmed. He did say something more like it was instinctual. That being said, I appreciate everyone pointing out how it being accidental or instinctual, the reaction is a red flag. I've talked to someone and I'm going to end things. Really, thank you everyone who left input. Maybe I sound stupid and naive I just never thought this would happen.",

I never get on TikTok talking, but I'm on day three of quitting this saw. And I'm gonna come on here and kind of talk about why I'm doing it. Maybe get some accountability and tell you how I've been feeling. So day one through three. Day one wasn't really anything besides just like keeping my... Like cravings that day because I was really having cravings just more so keeping that routine away. Like naturally wanting to get up to do that because that's what I've always done type situation. And I would say that's probably a lot of the past couple of days. Now that we've hit day three, we're still in the morning so I can't really talk too much. Last night I was pretty irritable, pretty tired, got annoyed really easily, but I journaled, tried to get my crap together. And then we woke up this morning. I don't feel as bad as like the first day, but definitely got some steps to go. So I just kind of wanted to document my hearing now. I've already lost 10 pounds. Okay, in a matter of three days I've lost 10 pounds. So wait, it's falling off me because I'm not eating much because you know, who has an appetite. I'm like a little way, baby, I can't eat unless I smoke. So here we are.

Do something with yourselves people. I am not the only person that smokes while pregnant. I'm gonna admit it. I was vaping. I vaped to quit smoking. My bad that I'm trying to better myself so I can take care of my child. It's actually funny how people don't know the story of how it's hard to quit smoking. And then they bash other people because they don't understand what it's like. I'm not bullying. I'm not harassing. I'm just saying, my OB told me, as long as I cut back, I'm fine. Because if I quit smoking, it will put my baby under so much stress that it could kill him. And right now with me being 31 weeks, I could have him early. And then there will be complications, not because of smoking, but because of the stress. So next time anybody wants to comment like this, you will be blocked. Because I'm not the only mother that smoked while they were pregnant. Tons of people out there that do it. My mother did it. My sister did it. My other sister did it. There's a lot of people out there. So I know I'm not the only one. I'm not getting is good. I'm saying that it is wrong for you to bash somebody because you don't know if they're trying to quit or not. You automatically assume I'm careless. I'm not careless. I do care. That's why I'm trying to quit. So next time you want to comment something like this? Know the story.","Fashion accessory, Human face, Clothing, Boy, Girl, Man C, I, is that a filter that, AA, J, O, AD, out of your mouth, while pregnant..here's, AVA, while pregnant ...here's, a, M, MD, Reply to momOfcole's comment, while pregnant...here's, -, S, shows smoke coming, d TikTok, TikTok, @itzyagirl_audrayyy, Reply to momfcole's comment, me praying for a filter., c TikTok, ND, ANVA"
7267977384387792170,It’s day two of my journey to quit smoking! I am actually really proud of myself for making it to day two as I really haven’t had success in the past. I haven’t had a puff of a cigarette in over 24 hours and that makes me so happy. I don’t want my kid to lose his mom early to cancer like I did. That isnt fair to him. I want to meet and to help raise my grandkids if my son ever chooses to have them! If you want to learn more about my process in quitting smoking you can watch that here:  @Makeup Fresh ," Welcome to day two of quitting smoking. It is only day two and already I have it above them the road. My son and I are going swimming today, so I can't wear the patch. So immediately I was like a crap. You know, didn't plan for that. Luckily I have nicker red. And the reason I have that is that's basically part of my step two of all of this. And what I'm going to be using when I start to wean. Here's not working for me. Anyway, so the nicker reds and allow me to go to the pool and just use those for the morning and hope that that kind of holds me down until I can apply the patch after I get home and shower. Because I really don't want something as little as going to the pool totally like ruining my day. But I have not smoked and I'm really, really proud of myself because I've not gone this long besides, you know, being pregnant and that was incredibly hard to do as well. So, you know, a whole day in without smoking a cigarette is pretty incredible for me. I am trying to take everything, you know, one day at a time which is kind of what they tell you to do with any addiction. But, you know, it's hard thinking about the steps to come and I'm again, just I'm really proud of myself with what I've done thus far. The cyclone pods have been incredibly helpful. So, whatever I have the urge to smoke a cigarette I just hit that and it gets that hand in mouth motion it gets that just it really, really helped. It helps a lot.

So I'm very sorry about that so I have for legal reasons I was smoking cigarettes and chewing as an adult so I've been doing it for a long time and Memorial Day of 2020 I decided to take my birth control out. We decided to start trying for a baby and then it took up until July to conceive the baby, but about five, six weeks before we actually conceived. I noticed like my lungs started right out. Like if you smoke for a long time, you kind of feel a little weasy a little bit so I decided to take a break and I just supposed to be only a temporary break and then I found out it was pregnant. I don't know how to help, I really don't. I did try other methods like lowering my nicotine or limiting how much I could have or certain locations that I could or could not vapor smoke. So yeah",

Mad, let me tell you how my non-smoking journey deteriorated last year. Four years. And I mean, hundred years I would lay in bed every night and I'd be like, please, high of how I take the succession and compulsion away from me. Let me wake up tomorrow a non-smoker, like the days that I woke up in the obsession and compulsion to shoot up, Schmecken-Pete means which lifted from me, p- ee. I have said for years that I would rather quit slamming dope again. Because just put me in a box and a box and a box for a while and I'm fine. Because I don't walk down the street every day and see people fucking- Come on, I was slamming fucking dope! You know what I mean? You know what I do see every day? All day every day, people fucking smoking. People fucking smoke my- Wait, why? Why am I this color? Is there a filter on? Why am I this color? I got a new foam. Everything's. I digress. Last year, June 1st, I had ran out of cigarettes the night before. I was like, I'll just get some tomorrow and you know what I didn't do? I didn't get any more. I was like, you know what? Uh, uh, uh, Pfft, d- DONE. Pow! Just done. And it was a big deal. I- I was just- I didn't mean it was hard, but like, I did it. And then, um, August 3rd, my little baby cousin. She died of the COVID. Rest in peace, J. Now we miss you. And I didn't smoke for that. Didn't smoke for that. Until three days later, got the phone call in the middle of the night, then my other little baby cousin had passed away. It's not my business say-how. But she passed away. That was in the middle of the night. Saturday morning to Sunday morning. I went to my godmother's house in the middle of the night and I consoled her and then I went home and I got ready. And I went ahead and went to work. Okay, I had to- I had to go to work. And while I was at work, my brain pain pulled in the garden light, smoking a cigarette. And you know what? I- TODAYS THE DAY! So I went out, smoke cigarette, got high guy, a little looping. It felt really good. But I didn't start smoking all the time. I was smoking the weekends with Pam and I did pay her. I wasn't that guy that quits, quit buying and not quit, you know what I'm saying? I gave the money for what I smoked. And then it was fine. I was like a weekend warrior. I just smugged on the weekends because, um, my brain, I was like, this is gonna be totally okay. And then, on November 28th, shit fucking felt part real quick because I went to the doctor to have a fucking bar. And a few hundred stitches in my bar, huh? And my booty, huh? When I got out of the hospital, on the way home, I looked at Chad and I said, worst off, and get a gas station because I want a fucking cigarette. To which he responded to me, you have a couple hundred stitches in a place where no one wants a couple hundred stitches and you have an extra tunnel you can get whatever you want. And I said, I want a cigarette. And I've been fucking smoking ever since. And now, I'm going on a cruise in July and I don't want to be the motherfucker, chasing nicotine, all over the goddamn cruise, trying to figure out a place smoke. And then, in the beginning of August, I have fucking, I have to have another fucking surgery for my fucking secret tunnel. And you know what? I'm supposed to quit smoking six weeks before that. Now I'm fucking paying the game because it's not as easy to quit this time. Why did I start again? I have quit at different points in my life. A cocaine, pills, heroin, schmuffin' phetamine, and alcohol. But cigarettes have me by the fucking short and curly. Okay. And I am so pissed. I know I've got to quit again. I'm going to quit again.

7324665574255070507,My dad neglected me for his narcissistic wife who wants to get rid of me.#reddit #storytime #redditstories #storytelling #fyp #foryou ," My dad neglected me for his narcissistic wife who wants to get rid of me. Now that they have a son they want me to move out. My dad and my mom separated a long time ago because my mom messed around a lot with substances. Her pregnancy was very high risk because she found it really hard to quit smoking and drinking. My dad made her quick cold turkey, but he would always find her with a drink in hand. I didn't suffer a lot for it, but it definitely messed me up. When my mom gave birth, my dad went through with a divorce and got full custody of me. Since it was just us for a long time, I got very used to his presence and being the only girl in his life. He was a very busy man but he always made time to watch movies with me, take me on vacation out of state, we even went to Disney World once. It was amazing with it just being the two of us. But then Nina came into the picture. Nina was my dad's wife whom he married five years ago. I'll admit I didn't like her. She stole my dad away all the time. She would constantly want to go on dates with him so I had to stay with a babysitter or by myself when I got older. It got really lonely and I missed spending time with my dad. It seemed like Nina had it out for me and wanted him to start a new life with him and without me. She never even tried to bond with me. My dad would push for us to do girly things together, but Nina would always say she's too tired or say she already had plans. I got the hint and stopped involving myself with her. Because of this distance between us, my dad started to forget I existed. He would make dinner for the two of us and he got into the habit of only making portions for two. This meant that whenever he cooked, I would have to eat some leftovers or heat up some frozen food because Nina would always eat all of it. I've tried to talk to my dad about it, but he says I'm young and still trying to adjust to this life. I told him it's been five years already, I should be used to it by now, but things only. Get worse because Nina hates me. He tried to tell me that Nina was also struggling to adjust to having a daughter so I should cut her some slack. Since then, I stopped confiding in my dad because he never took my problems seriously. I also had no other support to fall back on because we moved away from my grandparents when my dad married Nina. His family also didn't get along with Nina because I used to tell them how she treated me when we still lived close to them. This caused a lot of problems and we had to move away, which I'm still sad about to this day. I didn't know this for a while, but my dad and Nina were trying to have a child but couldn't. They kept this a secret from me so right off of that they weren't onto a good start. Then, they used a sperm donor because my dad found out he couldn't have any more kids.","Tomato, Poster, Fruit, Coffee Cup, Vegetable, Dairy Product, Dessert, Human hand, Food, Wok, Snack wife, now that they, cooked, substances, Disney World, adjust to this life, sad about to this, eat some, but he would, with it just being, and we had to, and got full, take me on, found it really, C TiKTOk, hot, or say she, I'll admitIdidn't, DASH, since it was just, messed me up, I've tried to talk, to tell them how, because of this, since then I, my dad would, Flavored, still trying to, Down, <>, la, the two of us, stopped, s wife, smoking and, because my dad, making portions, d TikTok, too tired, 9, secret from me, |, 888, or say sho, the habit of only, but Nina would, who wants to get, 9o To, mom separated a, lot for it, Nina were trying, Ergo Tou, only girl in his life, c TikTok, and he got into, lonely, divorce, when my dad, Caubon, ON, she treated me, dinner for the, it, I told him it's, been 5 years, C TikTOK, it got really, gave birth, plans, made time to, through with a, @reddit, to, it was amazing, they want me to, Max, once, to forget I, for a while, fall back on, because we, already, but he always, with her, @rea.dit.helge, I'm young and, hates me, but couldn't, to go on dates, have a son, when I got older, C TikTok, so I should cut, c, because she, Ergo To, TikTol, and I miss, frozen food, Nina was my dad, other support to, already had, to have a child, lived close to, C TikTOk, married Nina, @reoalt helge, because he, involving myself, TikTok, any more kids, his presence, me that Nina was, when my mom, between us, Ergo Touch, meant that, Part, he tried to tell, confiding in my, they weren't on, rop, dad, J who wants to get, ellrona, Un, together, always find her, leftovers, whom he, she never even, rid of me, for two this, JONKER, we even went to, O TikTok, didnit get along, Time, constantly want, get worse, Power Temp., years ago, or by myself, my dad, push for us to do, whenever he, Power Temp.

7277516193525697798,the effect of smoking/Alcohol during pregnancy ," Hello everyone, it's a good day and I hope you're having it with one as well. Today I'll be talking about the effect of smoking during pregnancy. Smoking during pregnancy exposes you and your baby to a high risk of complications during pregnancy. If you smoke while you are pregnant, it increases the chance of you having serious complications, serious health problems during pregnancy. Once you are likely to give birth to a low-bath with baby and low-bath with baby, they are vulnerable to infections, greasier risk of death, difficulty in breathing and long-term health problems in the future in adulthood. Even if you try to cut down the no-bub's secrets you take in a day, it will not reduce the risk of you having complications. So in order for you to have a healthy baby, quit smoking. It will help you as a mother, as some of these complications that arise during pregnancy when you smoke. One is atopic pregnancy, that is pregnancy aside uterus, particularly in the fallopian tube and premature rupture of membrane, premature liver. In try-you-try and filter death known as IUD, spontaneous abortion known as miscarriage. Placenta abrasion is partial separation of the placenta from the uterine wall. I know what that means. It's really to reduce the supply of oxygen to the baby. And the baby is at risk at that time. Placenta previous, that is the placenta is lying on the lower uterine segments. If you are pregnant and you are smoking. If you are a pregnant, you are a pregnant, you will have to use a secret you smoke. Reduces baby movement in the womb for at least an hour after smoking each secret. Every time you smoke a secret, it reduces oxygen and nutrients supply to your own bone baby increase the risk of bad defects such as cleft lead and cleft pallet. It's slow as baby growth and development. Smoking can impair baby's brain development and lungs development as well. It reduces breast-mic supply and the quality of breast-mic as well. Smoking during pregnancy can increase the rate of long-term illness in your child, even for years to come. And such is high risk of asthma. Wicker lips, wicker lungs, tytoid diabetes, high blood pressure in adulthood and increase risk of attention deficit, high partivity disorder. These are the complications that arise. Please, quit smoking and have a healthy baby. When you don't, they have a long-term complications. And even in neutral, it causes problems as well for the baby. The placenta will not be working fine, good enough. That's called placenta insufficiency. It really impair the function of the placenta for your baby, thereby causing so much harm to your child. Thank you for watching this video. And I hope you have learned something from this. Please, it is contribution, questions, your opinion. Please feel free to write them in the comments section. And don't forget to like, comments and share this video. Thank you very much.",
7226426977941589294,"Weird and disturbing pregnancy facts. From out of control estrogen to newborms with teeth, we are going for a ride today. #pregnantlife #pregnancyjourney #momsoftiktok #anatomy #sciencetok #weirdfacts "," and possibly disturbing pregnancy facts come an acha. As you're going through the hostage situation known as pregnancy, you may feel like you're losing control. That feeling is not just in your head, it is factually true. You will produce more estrogen during pregnancy than you would in an entire lifetime if you hadn't gotten pregnant. And when I say you produce, that's not actually true. It's big daddy placenta entering into the picture. The placenta is the fetus's parasitic partner in crime and it is going to usurp all of your hormonal control. So if you feel like you're not quite yourself or you're a little bit out of control, there's a really good reason for that. Now let's talk about your blood supply. Because all my goodness is it going to increase. And it's not just by a small amount, we're talking about 40 to 50% increase in your blood volume. This increase in blood volume can cause swelling in the legs, varicose veins, high blood pressure, and even strokes. So why does your body do this to you? Again, this is out of your control. You can pin this all on an adorable little parasite needing to steal all your oxygen and nutrients. Thanks to all that extra blood, your heart is also going to enlarge. This is known as cardiomegaly and it's a normal adaptation to having to do all that extra work. But there's always a butt with these things. In rare cases it can result in peripartum cardiomyopathy. That's where the muscular walls of the heart become kind of floppy and they can't pump so good. I'd like to punctuate that this is very rare. Let's move on to something cuter. Well that's cuter in a really disturbing way. If you were unaware that newborns could have teeth, well now you know. Thankfully this is just Photoshop. It actually looks like this. They'll be tiny, they may even be loose and so a lot of times the doctor or nurse will take them out to prevent choking. Natal teeth are completely harmless and do not affect the development of baby teeth later on.

7140412181165690158,Replying to @danifiji22 this comment is frustrating and a clear example of survivorship bias. #pregnancytiktok #pregnancyjourney #1sttrimester ," The rest of this comment said, like every other 80s baby we turned out fine. All these bullshit rules these days is crazy. This comment is frustrating. Survivorship bias is the logical error of focusing on those that made it and overlooking those that did not, often because of a lack of visibility. This can lead to incorrect conclusions, like, everybody's gonna be fine because I'm fine. For example, smoking 10 cigarettes a day, lots of us 80s babies whose mother smoked while pregnant with us did in fact make it out alive. Many did not, and many more, did with complications that maybe this comment or it doesn't realize was the result of fetal nicotine exposure. But thanks to the fact that scientific research in the last 40 years actually does matter, which I have to state because this comment makes it seem like we should have just halted all scientific and medical research and advancements, because how could we possibly learn anything new since the 1980s? Thanks to this fact, we now know way more about the short-term and long-term negative impacts of fetal nicotine exposure on the baby. Things like fetal growth restriction and sudden infant death syndrome, which has seen two to five times more in infants exposed to nicotine in the womb. And in the long term, we have evidence to show the fetal nicotine exposure increases risk of type 2 diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, and fertility issues later in life, and that's after controlling for things like maternal diet or socioeconomic status. And more, there's likely also an increased risk for things like ADHD, exaggerating anxiety, and a high risk of drug addiction. So like, are we all okay? It's the same in the nutrition space with nutrient recommendations during pregnancy, for example, prior to the 1980s, full of gas, its supplementation wasn't standard. We didn't realize that it could significantly decrease neural tube defects until that time. For example, the MRC vitamin study came out in 1991 and showed that 80% of neural tube defects could be prevented by taking just 4 milligrams of full of gas a daily. Sure, many of us born before 1991 didn't have neural tube defects. My mom was born in 1962, didn't have a neural tube defect, but significantly more babies did prior to supplementation practices. I'm actually constantly talking about how some of our nutrition guidelines are misguided or too restrictive for pregnancy. But that's because the evidence doesn't support them and there's a better way, in my view, to increase safety during pregnancy. Now because there's a bunch of people who are having healthy babies also engaging in unsafe behaviors, so all of these recommendations are dumb. That's survivorship bias. That's dangerous. Hope this clears up why.",
7077944621304941870,Reply to @customconcerned," Hi, it might not be acceptable to you, but a lot of doctors actually say it's okay for you to continue smoking when you're pregnant because it can cause too much stress for you and your baby and just slowly cut yourself down. I think the cigarettes are revolting, especially since I've been pregnant, they make me sick. My doctor says, okay, if I smoke a vape for a little bit and cut myself down, I did try the patches, but I have very sensitive skin and I had literal welts from trying the nicotine patches. And the weed thing, zo-fran is okay for you to take, but it's had studies done on it where it can cause birth defects in the first trimester. And I had all full morning sickness with Kinsley. My doctor already knew that I smoked marijuana because, you know, PTSD, bipolar, got some stuff going on up here. And he said that it was fine for me to use marijuana to eat.",

That was with my first. My second was two days late. Erie was six days late. Mariah was two days early. She would have ran late. So if this one comes early, doing me a favor, doing me a favor, doing me a favor, because I have a bad hip. And I'm going to be needing surgery. And I no longer smoke obviously because I they because it's safer. It's the best. No, I know that. But it's a lot safer than lighting up a fucking cigarette every five fucking minutes. I don't do drugs. I do no drugs. I don't even smoke weed. I don't do none of that. I don't take any of the medications I'm supposed to because that's volume in X. It's supposed to be on those for the past four years. And here I am not on it. So on the babysitter thing, I have my mom. I have my mother-in-law. My mom's a state home wife who I trust with all my heart. Obviously it's my mother. My mother-in-law trust her. You know why? She's a licensed. Let me repeat it. Licensed daycare provider through the state. I don't not have a babysitter. It's who's going to take who and when? So I don't understand why you want to come on here and troll me on a really bad day. Might be something with you because there's nothing wrong with me besides I'm hurting for my best friend and her entire family. And yeah, so go ahead and I hope you step on a few thousand Legos today. Okay? Fuck you and get off my page.","Human face, Woman, Boy, Clothing, Man, Glasses, Person , 2, wl, be, on, I, tnt of, wen, h, J, >, de, @justiceforairy, 7, E, en, o, gded to, F, iat, sppted, X, w, thet, P, thne, a, t, th, ?, pted, S, -, d TikTok, mt, Reply to mamaintx's comment, TikTok, ayks, nt a, Jo den, d, ther, amyh, thanr od, e, thner, thaner o, N, *, thnst, 1, thant, babysitter ever again?, You vape while pregnant?

6871671970866433285,#fyp. #psa. #13weekspregnant #vaping.  Slowing down on vaping till I quit.," So for anybody who has seen yes, my vape and my videos, it knows that I am pregnant with my third baby. I am 13 weeks. Yes, I vape. Yes, I don't vape all the time. I'm slowly cutting myself down. Because quitting cold turkey, why being pregnant, can harm the baby more than just a little bit of nicotine. This is my second child. I vape with him while I was pregnant. He is almost three years old. He is perfectly fine. He was a perfect fine little baby when he came out. And if anybody has an issue with it, they can at least delete themselves off my page or write me and tell me. And then I can tell them to leave me alone or block them. Because vaping during your pregnancy does not harm you. And you should know who I'm talking to because she's only 18 with one baby and came at me for vaping.",
6899609125483744518,Reply to @janicekessler3," Let's go ahead and address this since there was 71 likes on it. First and foremost, obviously I posted videos of my daughter, one daughter, one singular baby. Obviously not pregnant. All my videos that you've seen in my body, I'm obviously not showing. Yeah, I guess you're right. Okay, well maybe she's not showing yet. But no, I'm not pregnant. So before you go and give un-solicited advice and look stupid as fuck, maybe you should do your research sis. Because you're growing pregnant, she is a mom to a beautiful seven-month-old daughter though. And if I want to vape when she's not around, I can. And I will. So have a happy fucking Thanksgiving.",

7314877564500217134,Replying to @Sharrie #pregnant #pregnancy #smoking #vape #chemicals #nicotine #addiction #longtermeffects #sunsgodess ," Okay, so this is actually something that I did talk to the lady at QTIP today about. If you're wondering what QTIP is, you can go watch my last video. But we were discussing vaping because she said a lot of people will actually switch over to vaping. The problem with that is that one, we still don't know exactly what chemicals are in them. Two, we don't know what the long-term effects of those chemicals are on even our own bodies. Let alone on pregnancy. Also, vaping contains a higher nicotine content than smoking. Therefore, it can actually make it harder to quit in the long run. So, I have considered it in the past. It is not something I'm interested in doing, especially after talking to the woman today, because I really just want to quit. I really just want to be done with it. I don't want to have that crutch anymore. So really, right now, it's just about finding rewards for myself, finding that positivity, finding that support. And I know I have so much of that here, and I love that. And you are one of those people that are definitely very supportive. Yeah, so do a little bit of research because they've actually done quite a bit of research more recently about this, and have definitely found that it is actually not any healthier. It actually may be worse for you possibly, but we don't know yet. And we won't know for a while, because it's still new. Anyway, thank you for your comment, because it did allow me to bring up the fact that that was something that we discussed today, and that research is showing that it is definitely not any safer and could possibly be more harmful. So, appreciate you. Thank you.",

7279134480248474926,Replying to @Leaf #greenscreen ," Yeah, yeah, that's true. See, all of this happened in full view of the security cameras. They're like smack in the middle of one of the field of view of the security cameras. Like, this is the view of the security cameras and like, this is the usher asking them to leave. Like, that's her date and then that's Lauren Bobert and then this is the pregnant woman. So the pregnant woman was one row back and one seat over from Lauren Bobert. And like, I zoomed in here, right? So you can see Bo- that's her hair, like her dark hair leaned over, listening to the usher and then this is the pregnant woman. Apparently after the fact Bo-bert tried to claim that she was not vaping and that it was a fog machine from the show. But on the video, you can see her do this and then vapor leave her mouth. So that's a lie. And in the folding video, you can see the pregnant person lean forward and talk to Bo-bert. Allegedly, she asked Bo-bert to stop vaping and Bo-bert said no. Like, it's just rude to vaping doors in a situation like that anyway, much less right next to a pregnant person. Like, if you can't put your vape down for what the three and a half hours or so for a Broadway show, including intermission, you got a problem. She tried to like vape on the congress floor because they're there for like, you know, a whole work day sometimes on occasion. Also, they were like clearly being real rude when they were escorted out too. Like, this is one from the lobby after they were escorted out, right? Like, the Beetlejuice branding. She look big-mad.

I wish for that kid I pray for them but that their healthy is can be but it is so clear that you're introducing a laundry list of toxins to the lungs and they're getting into the bloodstream and there are a number of them that cross the blood brain barrier and they think that if they're already pretty active physically active then they can offset some of them and they probably can but I think in the next five years or so we're just going to see a slew of studies showing that vaping is just bad for us especially for the developing brain.",

So if she was pregnant then maybe she would not be drinking but also maybe she was not pregnant at that exact moment in time or she did not know about her pregnancy at that exact moment in time. And then also the fact that she also was captured by paparazzi outside the filming of the reunion with Tom SantaVal. You know when they were wearing those black incognito outfits they matched and they were wearing black and they look like super villas.

7300979408125300014,WHO BE VAPING NOWADAYS ? 🤯🤯#andrewhuberman #science #fypシ #vaping ," Do you think we should be about vaping? We should be very concerned. So when it comes to smoking or vaping, the thing that's being consumed, the thing that people are trying to put in their bloodstream, nicotine cannabis, et cetera. And let's just set those aside. I've done episodes on nicotine and cannabis and they have their application. They also have their problems. Vaping is terrible because of the other chemicals that delivers to the lungs. It's also very clear and we haven't released this episode yet, but I talked to a female hormone dog from Austin, Natalie Crawford, so OBGYN. Vaping is associated with disruptions in egg health and what they call egg quality can create certain mutations in eggs and serious endocrine issues in women. Personally, I find it disgusting. Like I just find it like I don't do it, but when I see people vaping, like to me, and listen, I used to it when growing up, I quit smoking a long time ago, but I used to smoke a bit of nicotine growing up. Remember I was a wild one, but that's not what I did it. I just, you know, nicotine works for me as a drug and I don't do it anymore. But vaping is so addictive. It's a mutagen. It mutates the genes of cells. It mutates the genes of rapidly dividing cells most. So breast cancers, ovarian cancers, egg quality, sperm are constantly turning over. So people always say, oh, well, I vape all the time and I got so-and-so pregnant or whatever. When they say I have a perfectly healthy kid, that kid might have been much healthier. And also the kid's not grown up yet, like introducing me to the kid later. I wish for that kid. I pray for them, but that their healthy is can be. But it is so clear that you're introducing a laundry list of toxins to the lungs and they're getting into the bloodstream and there are a number of them that cross the blood brain barrier. And once they cross the blood brain barrier, those neurons by virtue of the fact that neurons don't turn over across the lifespan, you've born with the ones you're going to die with. You might add a few across your lifespan, but you're mostly born with the ones that you're going to die with. Well, they're going to harbor those chemicals and those particulates. And yes, we have a grandparents that smoked and lived to be 90, but those are generally the outliers. So I can't find one good reason why people should vape. If people want nicotine in their system that badly and here I'm not recommending that, they would be much better off relying on a troture, a patch or even toothpicks or injectable. I know people I'm not going to out any nicotine. Oh, I'm not going to out anyone here, but I know people in our podcast community that rely on nicotine injections for hot cold. That is so hot cold. Yeah, I don't. It causes elevation and blood pressure. It causes these are constriction, but it also will robustly increase focus and attention to the end of the world. I'll tell you. I'm lining nicotine. You're starting to see some companies that offer things like NAD infusions also offer subcutaneous or nicotine injections going back to the or patch or gum. Smoking for a very long time, everyone knows a huge campaign, which I think was pretty effective. Actually, it's kind of discouraging people from smoking or at least making them aware about the do you remember how they got kids to stop smoking? They told them for years it was bad for their health. That didn't work. They told them that it was putting money in the pockets of these like these old cackling white guys that were like rubbing their hands in a capitalism and making a ton of money and then it became the rebellious thing to quit smoking. That would be effective. I think about this all the time that there was a big push to both disincentivize and make more different smoke, make more difficult smoking. Go to go outside. There's the smoking area. I've worked in clubs one year before the smoking ban came in in the UK and then people had to go outside, just friction, friction, friction all the way down. Then vaping came in and vaping is way more enjoyable of an experience than smoking ever was. You can have a higher dose of nicotine that tastes enjoyable, bubblegum, bubblegum,",

7264579159752559914,"Happy Sunday My Beautiful Friends, Today is day one my last journey with Addiction & the last if my skeleton in the closet to deal with!!  I started smoking marijuana at the age of 15 so I’ve had an addiction to it much of my life I have quite a few times throughout my life during pregnancy and maybe one or two other times for a short period but always went back!!  Because I struggled with ADHD when I was younger and nobody knew this it was my way of coping with it so I’ve done it for a really long time!!  As you all know I have been transforming my life and this is just Another journey and Addiction I need to overcome to live my best life and be the person that I was destined to be!!!  If there is a will there is a way!!! I hope all of you struggling know that you have to make changes in your life it’s not just gonna happen for you, you are strong and you can honestly do whatever you set your mind to do!!  Hope y’all have an amazing day and I will keep you all updated as I continue this journey!!! It’s definitely not gonna be easy especially quitting vaping because I have been doing it way too much lately and due to my asthma this really will be over all the best decision I can make in my life right now!!  If you don’t like it you gotta do something to fix it!!  Much Love Always My Friends, 🥰❤️MISHI❤️ #mildredunp#mildredunpluggedo1#mishimoto1🌸n #addictionnr#addictionrecoveryna#addictionawareness ##sobrietye#mishissoberjourney##maryjanei#skeletonsinmycloset☠️🖤r#gottabestrong💪💪i#behonestwithyourselfh#neverlosehopey#believeinyourselfeb#youaretheboss  #yourlifeth#liveittothefullestp #fypkt#fyp#i#tiktokm #instagram  #facebook#f#fbreelsf#foryouge#foryoupage❤️❤️ ##behappybe#liveyourbestlife  #4youpagere#4uu#youareenoughel#anotherreleasee#lastjourney##igotthis##imstrongh#liveittothefullest #selfloveec#selfrespectse#loveyourselfan#youcanchangee#itsachoicehe#youholdthekeye#imhealingeverydayt#lifeisgettingbetter❤️❤️"," Happy Sunday my beautiful friends. How are you guys today? It's been a while guys, but I'm back. I've just been struggling with my mental capacity. These last couple, six weeks or so. And it's been mentally taxing after vacation. Vacation was amazing. I still got to share with that with all the stuff we did. Like it was truly an amazing vacation. So I'll still be working on those and sharing those throughout. But today is the start of my last, hopefully last journey that I have to take. Struggling with addiction. I have smoked marijuana since I was 15 years old. And it is time. It definitely is not good for ADHD, which I just found out I have severe ADHD at 34 years of age. So I am going to do stuff that makes my ADHD better. And if I don't take action and do that, nobody's going to do it for me. So nobody can make me quit. Nobody can talk me into quitting. Like that's a decision you have to make on your own. Same with alcohol, same with losing weight. You have to decide right here that you want to do it. That you're going to do it. So I'm ready. It's taking me a little while to get my mindset right. But I'm ready. Me and Scott have not had a cigarette in 10 months today. So I figured this would be a great day to start my new journey. No smoking cannabis and no vaping. And it is. It's going to be a challenge. I know that. So I might be starting over. I don't know. And yesterday I started my new ADHD medication. This is 18 milligrams of concerta. And I can't even tell you guys the night and day difference I had yesterday. Like I got a... I wasn't losing shit all day. I wasn't spending my time looking for my vape. We're looking for my phone. I think yesterday I asked twice where's my phone. Normally it's like 60 times. Not that many, but that was an exaggeration. But yeah, it's a lot. I feel like I lose a lot of things with my ADHD and it's annoying. It was driving me crazy. So I'm going to continue to take that. My doctor does want me to win off cannabis. And I was going to try to just quit like full force. But she has asked that I just gradually lean myself off of it. So nonetheless, I'm not going to be smoking it. I will just be taking gummies because where I'm trying to quit vaping, I don't need to be smoking something else. That's just going to remind me of vaping. That's what I'm prepared to do. It's a 1135. I haven't had one vape today. I haven't had any cannabis. So I guess we'll see how the day rolls on. I'm just going to try not to do any of it. So today's day one. I'm ready. Ready to go. Is ready as I'm going to be. I mean, I don't know how much more ready I can be than this. So I'm going for it. Wish me luck. It's going to be a trial and air type thing. I just have done it since I was 15. So the last 30 years I've smoked and the last 30 years I've smoked cannabis. So I guess we shall see. Anyhow, we are going just skiing guys. I hope you have an amazing day. Got my bikini on that I said I was going to wear out. I'm worried about. I don't care. 305 to 172. I was exactly 172.0 today. So last time I talked to you guys I was 165. I gained a little bit of weight. I gained 3 pounds on vacation. But I gained 5 pounds before I left on vacation just trying to get everything done. So I'm up a few pounds and that's okay because I know what I need to do to get back down. And I did talk to, I did go and have my consultation for my skin surgery removal. And I have to lose down to 154. So I really need to lose 20 pounds before I go back into the doctor before they send that insurance. I have to have a BMI up 30 and my BMI right now is 32. But I want to tell you guys something that's amazing. When I started this journey, my BMI was 54. 54. I had a BMI up 54 you guys. So yeah, I'm way, way down from where I was at. I feel proud and I feel like nothing is going to stop me because it's not. Like I am ready to take this journey on as hard as it's going to be. I just know it will make me into the person that I'm truly meant to be. And cannabis has helped me back from a lot of things because I was arrested one time in my life for cannabis. After my divorce and I went to jail for five nights. So I mean, here in Utah, I'm under a doctor's care. It is medically okay. And I'm going to weed myself off because I know this is the last part of my journey, the last part of addiction, the last skeletons in my closet. And I'm going to show you guys that you can truly do anything you set your mind to do. I'm proved you guys are just a normal, average girl. That's it. If I can do it, every single one of you can do it. There's no excuse. It starts up here. You have to make the decision. You have to stick to the plan. You can't sway from it. You cannot sway from it. So if there's things that you want to do in life, get going because time is not slowing down. And I know you can do it. Believe in yourself. I believe in you. I'm here for support for any one of you going through journeys right now or trials. Or you just need a friend or someone to talk to or any of that guys. I'm home. I'm here. I'm available. Reach out to me. I want to know I love you guys a ton. Thank you for all the love and support throughout my journeys. It has been a while. Nine months. Started in November of last year doing TikToks and Reels. We're getting close to my one year mark. I've made a lot of friends and followers. So I appreciate all of you guys. And it's going to be a great road ahead. So I hope you guys continue to follow me. Peace and out for now, my friends. Love you lot.",

7269833442643168555,#greenscreen #greenscreenvideo #chrisean is trending again because on the latest episode of #zeus #chriseanandblueface she was seen hitting a #backwoods chileeeeee ," I'm a Hoot Booster Redder and make a fake and true bad tip. Tell me about this one and that's a mouth going home. I'm a Hoot Booster Redder and make a fake and true bad tip. Now after that episode of Cushion and Blueface had aired on Su's network this past weekend, people took to the internet because what is Cushion Rock doing if you know what I mean? And the controversy is all over the internet. Y'all, TMZ had published this article that said that Cushion Rock smoking while Pregos sparked furious fan debate and it does and we're going to get into this article. Now this is a tweet that kind of set it off by somebody by the name of Corey Letterman. They said, I love how since the episode of Cushion aired of her smoking profusely and calling her unborn baby, her fans are quite as kept. Nah, let's get this turned up a notch and said that baby is doomed before a burst, you can my head. They'll have eyes but no sense. Now TMZ was able to capture a lot of the comments in the comments section and somebody says, wait, Cushion is on TV smoking a blunt while pregnant? Which one of y'all foolish says that this baby would change her? Another person in common is that Cushion smoking is wild thumbs down. Another person stated that can we talk about Cushion smoking on camera and just filming around it? I swear no matter what hospital she gives birth that they will drug test her and that baby, which is absolutely 100% true. Because they drug test you even if you're not pregnant. Another person says, I know it's not my place but I have a small irritation seeing Cushion smoking while pregnant. Like, I'm a man. I will never experience pregnancy but I have a strong feeling that smoking or drinking isn't good at all for pregnancy. But there's always studies that come out that says, during pregnancy, one glass of wine per month is actually good for the baby. It's like heart healthy and things of that nature. But again, those studies are to be taken however you and your old BGYN or your gynecologist sees fit. But I've never seen a study that says smoking is good for the baby because again, smoking lowers the blood, the oxygen in your blood levels. So remember, one person is pumping all of the oxygen for that baby and that's the mom. So I don't see how decreasing the oxygen levels in your entire body could be good for the baby. But wine is a different story. TMZ even put this disclaimer here below. So the CBC strongly advises against smoking while pregnant. But her actions aren't illegal and Cushion still has some folks supporting her. And here they are. Somebody said, uh, Yossel worried about Cushion and her smoking. If her doctor said it's okay then shut the F up about it. But how do we know? Because we've never seen her doctor and what doctor would even make this type of recommendation? You guys can just pause to read the rest of this. But I want to hear from you guys. What do you think about this entire controversy around Cushion rock smoking while she's pregnant? What do you think is going to happen to the baby if it does test positive for, you know what I mean?","Fashion accessory, Mobile Phone, Human face, Woman, Clothing, Girl, Man, Glasses, Person shiii I'm not mad at chrisean if I was pregnant I would be hitting my j here, love how since this episode of, y'all FOOLISHLY said ""this baby would change her""? @, on, iosybystant, aclegal Your Service of Process Experts in, Can we talk at, 4, turnt up a notch thatw, CHRISEAN ROCK SMOKING WHILE, ea, pregnancy,, Wait..

So those two in the video, I agree with their saying, but there's exclusions. I did smoke air malprinicy. No, I'm not proud of it. Yes, I had to. I was chronically starving myself real bad. Like, I wouldn't be nothing during my whole pregnancy when I wasn't smoking. It wasn't because I was hungry, it wasn't because I was nauseous. I just had no appetite to eat anything. And I was starving my baby because I wouldn't eat nothing. So when I smoked, it gave me a little bit of, you know, the munchies, so I did eat. Some women just can't... I was hungry. Whether it's nausea, whether it's clamping, whether it's headaches, weed is beneficial for that. But if you're smoking just to get high, then yeah, that's the problem.

This is a scary thought. So this was a study that was done at about 1400 couples where they looked at the couples who were able to have pregnancy and the studies are showing that it's because we can actually affect the sperm DNA. So the sperm was strong enough to fertilize the egg but could not carry the pregnancy all the way through. So of course the study finishes by saying that we need more definitive studies to make sure. But you know what it says? If you are a couple that's trying to get pregnant, you should really refrain from smoking it. Both men and women.",

So what's up TikTok, it's your favorite nurse, Yomi Richardson, and other two bad nurses podcast. It is a lot that's trending on social media today, but when I was looking at this clip of Rihanna and her boo ASAP Rocky, I know I had to chime in. So a couple of disclaimers, Rihanna is your girl, she's my girl too, so please don't come for me in the comments. I like to rock a fenty face, I have the whole fenty collection, so we're on the same page with this. And thoroughly, the purpose of the two bad nurses podcast is never to tear anybody down, but for us as nurses, we see life through a healthcare lens and specifically through a nursing perspective. And so that's the way that I always approach every video, every topic, every subject, never to tear anybody down. So with that being said, let's take a look at this clip. So when I was thinking about how do I address this clip, I thought, let me break this up between Rihanna, Rihanna and the rest of us. So for those of you who engage in any kind of extracurricular habits or proclivities, fortunately, under the Affordable Care Act, Obama made it illegal for insurance companies to discriminate on people based off any kind of pre-existing condition. With that being said though, you don't want to implicate yourself in absolutely on social media because obtaining any kind of health or medical insurance is not self-check out. It's a human that you're going to have to interact and engage with. And you can best believe that that human is on social media and they're going to scrub and they're going to see, okay, is this a person that we want to ensure? So consider that when you're engaging in any kind of extracurricular habit and making the choice to post it on social media. So for Rihanna, we absolutely have to take her in the context for the island gal that she is. And then also too, that she's certainly has concierge medicine to where she's not worried about how she's being represented in the medical record or how she needs to behave in order to secure any kind of health or life insurance. So that part of the discussion that affects the rest of us is a material for her. But what affects all of us, including her, is secondhand smoke. So secondhand smoke among pregnant women has been linked to cleft lip, pre-term labor, low birth late babies, and also ceds or sudden infant death syndrome. The second hand smoke absolutely is correlated to the development of our baby's tissues, the heart, the brain, the lungs. And for those of us who are 80s babies, we can look at this video and say, ah, no big deal, our moms may have done worse. But don't forget those environmental considerations. The environment now is way worse than it is in the 80s. And they absolutely have a cumulative effect on conditions, both for our babies and for ourselves. So what we always want to do is limit those exposures, those innocuous exposures that are absolutely harmful, especially given what the maternal, the black maternal mortality rates are currently. They're horrific. And so we don't want to do anything that's going to contribute to that.","Fashion accessory, Necklace, Human face, Clothing, Swimwear, Woman, Girl, Person Rihanna is your girl, video, you're engaging in any, so for those of you who, the environment now is, extracurricular habits, Second hand Smoke, Second hand Smoktwobadnurses, this clip of Rihanna and, existing condition, Second hand Smok twobadnurses, discriminate on people, TiKTok, it is a lot this trending on, way worse than it is in the, is second hand smoke, baby's tissues the heart, Richardson of the 2 Bad, and making the choice to, medical record, d TikTok, so that part of the, it's your favorite nurse you, thought let me break this, insurance is not self, preterm labor, both for our babies and, so please don't come for, and then also too, LING, to where she's not worried, especially given what the, but for us as nurses, c TikTok, up between Rihanna, Second hand Smoktwobadinurses, Second hand Smoke twebadnurses, post it on social media, Second hand Smok&twabadnurses, conditions, TikTOk, and you can best believe, and specifically through a, and absolutely on social, we see life through a, Rihanrthts/apocky via, based off any kind of pre, Tik Tok, LOUDON, Second hand Smokgtwobadnurses, contribute to that, going to have to interact, among pregnant women, maternal, Second hand Smokg, (P, 80s, C TikTok, Rihanna and Asap Rocky via, and engage with, infant death syndrome, Second hand Smoktwobedhurses, exposures, C TikTOk, never to tear anybody, Second hand Smokgtwbadnurses, but don't forget those, that that human is on, I always approach every, for ourselves, TikTok, o TikTOk, they're horrific, and say, Second hand Smoketwobadnurses, down, Second hand Smok&twobadnurses, Nurses podcast, in order to secure any kind, in, or how she needs to, environmental, anything that's gonna, C TiKTOK, Second hand Smoktwebadnurses, tear anybody down, Instagram, healthcare lens, insurance companies to, we can look at this video, so what we always wanna, she's uncertain, but when I was looking at, so consider that when, I'm a registered nurse, owe me, want to ensure, face, those innocuous, o TikTok, and also SIDS are sudden, Second hand Smokg twobadnurses, how she's being, a, me in the comments, always approach every, let's take a look at this clip, about, and they absolutely have, has been linked to cleft lip, implicate yourself, @twobadnurses, and so that's the way that, -, Second hand Smoktwbadnurses, development of our, but what affects all of Us, Second hand Smoke twbadnurses, I have the whole Fenty, behave, OXI, this clip, social media, mortality rates are, take her in the context for, of health or life insurance, the purpose of the 2 Bed, considerations, social media today, £, Affordable Care Act, aTikTok, you don't want to, currently, TiKTOk, so we're on the same, the black maternal, is correlated to the, rest of USs, and thev're going to see, I want you to remember, represented in the, ah no big deal, and so we don't wanna do, engage in any kind of, TiKTOK, OXI:, J, do is limit those exposures, collection, habit, about how do I address, that are absolutely, JNG, a cumulative effect on, so a couple of disclaimers, aout, checkout, we absolutely have to, so for Rihanna, Rihanna and the rest of US, so when I was thinking, so with that being said, UNING EXERCIS, the island gal that she is, S, media, fortunately under the, rest of US, okay, it's a human that you're, kind of extracurricular, so secondhand smoke, discussion that affects the, nursing perspective, harmful, because obtaining any, her boot ASAP Rocky, Second hand Smok, kind of health and medical, Second hand Smoktwobadnuses, TikTOok, y'all like to rock a Fenty, 1, CTikTok, page with this, Nurses podcast is never to, AINING EXERCIS, Obama made it illegal for, is this a person that we, you know I had to chime, low birthcleate babies"

Okay, so I'm just gonna speak from personal experience and personal experience only I'm not about to pull up Google factoids or researchers or anything like that. Okay, do your own research. I don't give a shit So when I got pregnant my first two kids I didn't smoke any drink any of that prior During after none of that just wasn't something I did and then I started smoking like here's later down the road after I was working hours and hours and hours and all And and I was just exhausted. I need a way to distress. So fast forward to me Right before I get pregnant I ended up being put on SSRIs, you know all this nonsense And when I get to my doctors appointment very first one they asked me no to you doing drugs you drink and I'm like a Definitely drink not anymore now that I found out and I was also smoking weed prior to that and I said to them, you know I'm obviously not gonna smoke and they like yeah, please don't I so what about my medications are they gonna affect the baby like they're chemicals man made chemicals lab made chemicals and They're telling me yeah, no go ahead take them a couple of my medications though I wasn't allowed to take because they were linked to severe burst effects And just all these problems. So I wasn't allowed to take certain medications and then I wasn't I still wasn't allowed to Take those same medications when I was trying to breastfeed So here's where I have a problem. So one point during my pregnancy I was taking Tylenol as they prescribed because I had a toothache and I was taking a lot of it like like the max amount They were letting me take and I was like, yeah, this doesn't feel right. I was like you sure I can't have like a bowl to like take this Like pain away and they're like no you can't and they were making me feel really really dirty about it Like I was doing something wrong. So obviously I'm not gonna fucking smoke I mean while I know people Personally, okay, personally actively smoked cigarettes throughout their pregnancies because their doctors literally told them it was safer for them to smoke the cigarette during the pregnancy Then not too because it was gonna cause more harm to them and the baby because of like the adverse effects of their addiction So here's where I'm confused. Everybody wants to bash moms who smoke weed or try to smoke weed because they don't want to take Lab-created medications and then their moms do that and then they still get shit right because they're not supposed to take Medications or chemicals in their body, right? You're gonna be mad at a mom for eating a deli sandwich You're gonna come out of mom for you know having a single glass of wine in her entire pregnancy Even though there are other countries that do it regularly like I'm not saying they're fucking thrown back drinks But you'll have a glass here there whatever it's not the end of the world because it's in moderation and Their countries aren't peddling all this propaganda bullshit like Again, make the right decisions for you and your family and your body and your children But fear-mongering isn't and there's no way anybody's gonna convince me that chemicals are safer than a plant.

Now that they have a son they want me to move out. My dad and my mom separated a long time ago because my mom messed around a lot with substances. Her pregnancy was very high risk because she found it really hard to quit smoking and drinking. My dad made her quick cold turkey, but he would always find her with a drink in hand. I didn't suffer a lot for it, but it definitely messed me up. When my mom gave birth, my dad went through with a divorce and got full custody of me. Since it was just us for a long time, I got very used to his presence and being the only girl in his life. He was a very busy man but he always made time to watch movies with me, take me on vacation out of state, we even went to Disney World once. It was amazing with it just being the two of us. But then Nina came into the picture. Nina was my dad's wife whom he married five years ago. I'll admit I didn't like her. She stole my dad away all the time. She would constantly want to go on dates with him so I had to stay with a babysitter or by myself when I got older. It got really lonely and I missed spending time with my dad. It seemed like Nina had it out for me and wanted him to start a new life with him and without me. She never even tried to bond with me. My dad would push for us to do girly things together, but Nina would always say she's too tired or say she already had plans. I got the hint and stopped involving myself with her. Because of this distance between us, my dad started to forget I existed. He would make dinner for the two of us and he got into the habit of only making portions for two. This meant that whenever he cooked, I would have to eat some leftovers or heat up some frozen food because Nina would always eat all of it. I've tried to talk to my dad about it, but he says I'm young and still trying to adjust to this life. I told him it's been five years already, I should be used to it by now, but things only. Get worse because Nina hates me. He tried to tell me that Nina was also struggling to adjust to having a daughter so I should cut her some slack. Since then, I stopped confiding in my dad because he never took my problems seriously. I also had no other support to fall back on because we moved away from my grandparents when my dad married Nina. His family also didn't get along with Nina because I used to tell them how she treated me when we still lived close to them. This caused a lot of problems and we had to move away, which I'm still sad about to this day. I didn't know this for a while, but my dad and Nina were trying to have a child but couldn't. They kept this a secret from me so right off of that they weren't onto a good start. Then, they used a sperm donor because my dad found out he couldn't have any more kids. With that came along my half brother Mark. Sharing my dad with Nina was already a lost cause and now I had to share him with a sibling too. It really felt like Nina was trying to keep me out of this family since she was really pushing on the two of them having kids. Seeing my dad felt like a miracle since Mark was born. We used to spend two days a week together without Nina, but he told me he couldn't do that anymore with a new baby in the house. He explained that he couldn't leave his wife alone for two days a week with a newborn. I was obviously very angry about it because Nina had taken so much away from me. I kept distancing myself from them and they didn't even bother to check up on me. I wasn't seeking attention, but they hadn't heard from me or seen me in nearly a week and my dad never asked about it. Well, three days ago, he finally talked to me but it wasn't for the reason I wanted. I thought he was going to tell me he wanted to hang out with me like we used to or just have a nice conversation with me, but no. Him and Nina had decided to make a nursery for Mark instead of having him in their bedroom. I asked what was the problem with that and he said they just wanted their privacy. So, our home has two master bedrooms and two bedrooms on the other side of the house.

Now that they have a son they want me to move out. My dad and my mom separated a long time ago because my mom messed around a lot with substances. Her pregnancy was very high risk because she found it really hard to quit smoking and drinking. My dad made her quick cold turkey, but he would always find her with a drink in hand. I didn't suffer a lot for it, but it definitely messed me up. When my mom gave birth, my dad went through with a divorce and got full custody of me. Since it was just us for a long time, I got very used to his presence and being the only girl in his life. He was a very busy man but he always made time to watch movies with me, take me on vacation out of state, we even went to Disney World once. It was amazing with it just being the two of us. But then Nina came into the picture. Nina was my dad's wife whom he married five years ago. I'll admit I didn't like her. She stole my dad away all the time. She would constantly want to go on dates with him so I had to stay with a babysitter or by myself when I got older. It got really lonely and I missed spending time with my dad. It seemed like Nina had it out for me and wanted him to start a new life with him and without me. She never even tried to bond with me. My dad would push for us to do girly things together, but Nina would always say she's too tired or say she already had plans. I got the hint and stopped involving myself with her. Because of this distance between us, my dad started to forget I existed. He would make dinner for the two of us and he got into the habit of only making portions for two. This meant that whenever he cooked, I would have to eat some leftovers or heat up some frozen food because Nina would always eat all of it. I've tried to talk to my dad about it, but he says I'm young and still trying to adjust to this life. I told him it's been five years already, I should be used to it by now, but things only. Get worse because Nina hates me. He tried to tell me that Nina was also struggling to adjust to having a daughter so I should cut her some slack. Since then, I stopped confiding in my dad because he never took my problems seriously. I also had no other support to fall back on because we moved away from my grandparents when my dad married Nina. His family also didn't get along with Nina because I used to tell them how she treated me when we still lived close to them. This caused a lot of problems and we had to move away, which I'm still sad about to this day. I didn't know this for a while, but my dad and Nina were trying to have a child but couldn't. They kept this a secret from me so right off of that they weren't onto a good start. Then, they used a sperm donor because my dad found out he couldn't have any more kids. With that came along my half-brother Mark. Sharing my dad with Nina was already a lost cause and now I had to share him with a sibling too. It really felt like Nina was trying to keep me out of this family since she was really pushing on the two of them having kids. Sharing my dad felt like a miracle since Mark was born. We used to spend two days a week together without Nina, but he told me he couldn't do that anymore with a new baby in the house. He explained that he couldn't leave his wife alone for two days a week with a newborn. I was obviously very angry about it because Nina had taken so much away from me. I kept distancing myself from them and they didn't even bother to check up on me. I wasn't seeking attention, but they hadn't heard from me or seen me in nearly a week and my dad never asked about it. Well, three days ago, he finally talked to me but it wasn't for the reason I wanted. I thought he was going to tell me he wanted to hang out with me like we used to or just have a nice conversation with me, but no. Him and Nina had decided to make a nursery for Mark instead of having him in their bedroom. I asked what was the problem with that and he said they just wanted their privacy. So, our home has two master bedrooms and two bedrooms on the other side of the house. Those two bedrooms are empty so it was perfect for Mark, except Nina thought it was also difficult to go to the other side of the house multiple times at night when Mark woke up. I said that's why they should have him in their room, but my dad suggested something so much better. He wanted me to give up my master bedroom for this little baby.

We'll want a day be okay. 50 years ago, when my late wife first found out that she was pregnant, her OB-GYN asked if she smoked. She said she did.

And I've already made a video about this because before she like came out and said, yes, I still do that. She tried to say that she was using like a non-nicotine device and those still have formaldehyde in them. They're still not good for the development of the fetus. And now she's kind of okay, backtrack from that and been like, yeah, I am actually using the nicotine ones.

And a variation of comments of people saying they know someone or they themselves using nicotine throughout their pregnancy and thereby be was healthy and all of that. And that logic of better and not doing better just doesn't make sense to me because, yeah, back in the old days, people used to smoke packs and packs while pregnant women did. But in the old days, men could also be their wives and the wives, the cops wouldn't do anything if they called them. It was like, okay, we know that's wrong as a society now and we do better.

7343830270895770922,Can you vape while pregnant? #pregnancy #pregnanttiktok #pregnancytips #obgyn #pregnanttok ," So you just found out your pregnant and one of the things that you're wondering is can I continue vaping during pregnancy? We all know that smoking during a pregnancy is a no-go, but a lot of people don't associate vaping and smoking as the same thing. So can you use an esigirat or a vape during pregnancy? According to the Mayo Clinic, no you cannot. It says that most esigirats contain nicotine, which permanently damages a baby's developing brain and many other organs. Esigirat liquids also contain chemicals, flavors, and other additives that might not be safe for your baby. Also, a lot of pregnant women don't know if their esigirats contain nicotine or they might be using them as a way to quit or reduce cigarette smoking. Because if you're a smoker, you find out you're pregnant, you're like, oh, I can vape instead. And even though they have fewer toxins than a regular cigarette, nicotine exposure to any kind can still be harmful to your baby. So one of the best things you can do if you're pregnant and you are a smoker or your vapor is contact your primary care physician about quitting strategies, at least for the time that you're pregnant. Because unfortunately, if you are a smoker, vaping is still a no-go during pregnancy. My name is Danielle and I'm the head of medical education here at Angie Health and don't forget to follow me.

There's two addictions in one I'm addicted to the action of having something to vape on and I'm addicted to the nicotine itself So I'm like maybe if I break up this addiction into two phases, it'll be easier to quit So I thought I would just drop down and quit the nicotine and then whenever I got the nicotine out of my system Then I could break the habit of having something to actually vape because that's an addiction in itself is just Doing this action to your mouth all day within a week I quit vaping in general I was someone who would wake up in the middle of the night and turn the freaking bed over looking for my vape because I needed to hit it I was having like nicotine withdraws that bad. I was so addicted to this vape like the third or fourth day I realized that I would wake up and I did not have the craving for that vape I said like the fourth day I woke up I got in the shower. I made myself breakfast I sat down to start work and then I seen the vape on the couch and I completely forgot about the vape This is like four days in and I was extremely addicted to this thing So I thought it was gonna be a lot harder than what it was and so as soon as my fiance woke up I handed him the zero nicotine vape he already had my like true nicotine vape and took it away from me But I handed him the new vape that I bought that had zero nicotine and I said take this with you hot it do something with it I need to just like completely stop because I'm not having the nicotine cravings anymore So now I need to just get it out of sight out of mind and don't have it here whenever I'm bored and I want to like vape you know So now it works. Mikey took that with them to work every day and I don't leave anymore I still sometimes have the craving for it not really the nicotine but just like the fact that I'm sitting on the couch And like I'm used to doing this every few minutes, you know that is hard to quit Just like the action that's yeah, that's how I quit vaping and I am so proud I feel like a lot of it has to do with me being pregnant because I have that push factor like something to Quit for like you shocked he really didn't think I could do it because guys that thing had a chokehold on me But we're both so happy and that's just a little bit more ease of mind I have throughout this pregnancy I hope it helps when you guys",

I've heard about pregnant the last three four years has been eight pack a day um Sometimes more or less, but overall for like last four or five years has been a pack of day Like a pack of day and I put it down to seven a day. So it's a little It's getting a bit easier. It's just still hard but yeah today is day three of quitting cigarettes I have to suffer only half morning Um, that was my first morning cigarette that I've had and I still got all these Three So I take seven out every day. I get I give myself seven cigarettes a day now I get one in one in one at night. So there's two taking away and I got three four that I just went throughout the day um, and then Tomorrow it will be six a day But still one more one one at night. I don't go on and on until I get down to none So hopefully my cool if I'm back it out right on the calendar I should be be should be completely done with cigarettes by the end of jadeway Like either right at the end of jadeway or before But I should be doing by people we first know where cigarettes Um, I am picking up vaping.

7218232771515403563,"The past 16 days haven’t been easy, but it will all be worth it in the end 🤍 Luca will thank me. #firsttimemom #boymom #quittingnic "," I'm 17 weeks pregnant and tomorrow marks week 18 and tomorrow also marks 17 days of me being nicotine smokeless. Um, it's been sucking. For some context, I have been nicotine dependence since I was 11 years old when I first started smoking cigarettes. That's a whole other story, but I started smoking cigarettes at 11 years old. I am 22 and just now kicking the habit, hopefully, hopefully. The reason's taken me this long to quit. I never really had much incentive for quitting. I've tried a couple of times, quite a few times in the past, um, and I didn't have enough reason. I didn't care enough to quit. Uh, the only thing I cared about was that it cost a lot of money, but at the end of the day, I didn't really care that much. Um, the thing that gave me a reason was, you know, I have to take care of one of the person and right now we are sharing a vessel. So that's crazy. But as soon as I found out I was pregnant, I dropped down to 35 milligrams from 50 milligrams. Um, and then after that, to 25. And then for about four days, I just was vaping that elf bar. That zero milligrams just really tasty and it just helped me to get away from the habit of like pulling to your mouth, excuse me, and just hitting it. And it's, for the most part, been effective. I haven't touched anything since I threw away that elf bar because it was burnt up and gross. I haven't touched anything. I miss it. I miss it easily. I want something to vape. Hello babies. Hello. Me and one of us say hi. Hello. Come on. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Just a jerk. You can see her tan. But 17 days tomorrow, 16 today. And it sucks and it's hard. Hello. And I'm doing it for this guy. And hopefully, I'm done for good because nicotine is stupid. And I hope I can keep this up. So.",

7193405042601315589,Try to avoid smoking weed between 60-90 days within trying to get pregnant if you're struggling to ensure quality conception. #pregnant🤰 #hubermanlab #podcastclips #recreationaltherapy #miscarriageawareness #fertility #parentingtips #scientificfacts #birthratedecline #smoking #vaping ," What I said is that if you use cannabis once, then the sperm that are generated in the 60 days after that cannabis use are going to have a higher incidence of disrupted motility and perhaps morphology as well. Remember, sperm are continually generated every 60 days or so. And so if you use cannabis once, you are not forever disrupting your sperm, but if you are using cannabis and then you are looking to conceive in the next 60 days, you are going to be reducing, we think significantly so, the number of quality, forwardly, motile sperm. So, the simple takeaway from this is avoid cannabis use, although if you are going to use cannabis, and again, there are medical uses of cannabis and beneficial uses of cannabis for certain populations, it can be bad for other populations. We talked about that in the Hubert-Venlaub podcast all about cannabis, but if you're going to use cannabis, you should try and abstain from cannabis in the two months prior to the attempt to fertilize and get...","Fashion accessory, Watch, Laptop, Human face, Clothing, Man, Person every 60 days or s8crushedchills, you are going to bet, continually generated TikTok, Avoid Cannabis When, forwardly motile spePfryshedchillis, and perhaps morpholo@ikTok, and then you are looking, every 60 days or s8crushedchilis, disrupted motility@crushedchilis, reducing, you should try and, NO, okay remember sperma, populations, d TikTok, to conceive in the nextc5ikTok, CLIC, after that cannabis usushedchillis, but if you're going to us rikTok, the number of qualit TikTok, then the sperm that are, although if you are goi grikTok, and get pregnant@crushedchillis, CLICK, not forever disruptingushedchillis, use cannabis once, after that cannabis ugushedchillis, NOW, disrupted motility@crushedchillis, to conceive in the nextikTok, Trying to Get Pregnant, forwardly motile spefffyshedchilis, generated in the 60 days, TikTok, CUCK, but if you're going to urikTok, so the simple takeaway, generated in the 60 desikTok, All About Cannabisd TikTok, the attempt to fertilis TikTok, after that cannabis use, are going to have a, and again there are TikTok, higher incidence of TikTok, but if you are using, as well, 40, your sperm, forwardly motile spePfyshedchillis, in the 2 months prior to, to use cannabis @crushedchillis, we think significantly so, to conceive in the nexteikTok, generated in the 60 dosikTok, and get pregnant@crushedchills, medical uses of cannabisnedchillis, we talked about that f, and beneficial uses of, days, abstain from cannabiSushedchillis, and so if you use, C, cannabis use, forwardly motile spefryshedchillis, O, J, what I said is that if you, @crushedchillis, every 60 days or s8crushedchillis, cannabis for certaird TikTok, and perhaps morpholo@YikTok, the Uber and lab podeasthedchillis, you are going to be, NOY, cannabis once you ar, cannabis, we talked about that i, from this is avoid TikTok, it can be bad for other, CLCK, but if you are using TikTok"

7240408992374066478,"I’ve always been told to stop smoking because people say they feel better afterwards. I’ve stopped smoking serval times, it never improved the way I felt. After having a baby and going through postpartum depression and postpartum rage. I was told that I need to be put on a chemical medication to regulate my moods. I do not feel comfortable taking chemical medication‘s. So I took it upon myself to see if Mary Jane really is beneficial to me and my life. It made me realize that I was abusing it, but I was able to start using it for the right reasons instead. And that has completely improved my life. I know that some people really shouldn’t be using Mary Jane because it doesn’t improve anything for them. But I do think that this is a natural medication that could improve a lot of people’s lives if used correctly. It not only improved my life in an emotional way, but I’ve also been able to start eating more. ##maryjane##maryjanehelpsme##maryjaneadvocate"," Mary Jane has changed my life. I've been smoking for five years and this is the first year that it has changed my life. Okay, so for the past five years I've been smoking. I'm currently on a mental health journey. They want to chemically medicate me. I don't want that to happen. I don't want to take chemicals to be medicated and they want to medicate me for postpartum depression and postpartum rage. Those things can resolve themselves. I don't believe that I need chemicals pumped into my body to make me feel better. So I've taken it upon myself to look at my Mary Jane smoking out, but since the how the way it makes me feel and see for that actually a beneficial thing for me. So what I've noticed is that if I'm bored it only lasts about 15 minutes. It doesn't improve my emotions at all. No, and I'm having a manic moment where I'm just super super super super happy or I'm experiencing negative emotions. So anger, sadness, anxiety, you know, the list goes on. I smoke it lasts about an hour. So like around the time you see on the internet it lasts for and it actually improves my thoughts in my brain. It improves the actual motion itself. I calm down. I literally calm down. I look at the situation and I get through it in a positive way. So it helps me except for the past five years I've been abusing it. So I had no idea that I was smoking something that could have been helping me this whole entire time. And the reason why I'm posting this is because I had no idea and I'm sure there's a lot of people out there who have no idea. And so I think that if you're a Mary Jane smoker you should really pay attention to the way you feel before you start smoking in the way you feel after. Because for me this is a real life medication. This does improve my life. This makes my life easier. I'm not like a crazy smoker. I may be smoked twice a day once in the morning once at night. Sometimes it's a third in there. If I have a really really bad day and I'm staying home on I will smoke in the middle of the day because sometimes like those emotions get in and you just cannot control them. Like I said postpartum. So this is like a chemical imbalance. I cannot literally control. But yeah, Mary Jane is a medicinal property that can be used as a medication and I just want people to see this so they can look it into themselves. You know how to see how it's making them feel or even if you've never smoked Mary Jane and you're looking for something that's not a chemical that's going to improve you. You know maybe check it out.",
7318880379908132097,Some news for #Aussie vapers. #vaping #smoking ," Australian vapings changing in 2024, from the 1st of January, importing disposable vapes is being banned, even if they don't contain nicotine. That means things like this little guy will gradually be phased out. Expect them to be around a little while longer though. Shops can sell all their current stock, they just can't get new one shipped in. Things get tighter from the 1st of March though. From that date, there's a ban on importing non-therapeutic vapes, so unless you have a prescription, it's going to get difficult to get your hands on one. There'll also be tighter rules around who can sell vapes, what flavours and packaging they come with, and bans on making and promoting them.","Mobile Phone, Bottle, Human face, Clothing, Man, Person $25.95, i4, children an, linors or persons, GEXSPOO, 9 COLOURS, vape, IAN, CHERRY, expect them to be around a, SHISHA PODS, C TiKTOk, shops can sell, to purchase or use, COTINE, ID, CHERRYICE, Iows o, FILTER, 000 PUFFS!, they'll also be tighter rules, EPIC mod, IGET LEGEND DISPOSAB, it's gonna get difficult to get, importing disposable vapes is, fsons, CHER, Not s, minors or persons, IPLAY CUBE 1500 PUFFS DISPOSABLE VAPE, UNNPOD, 7 COLOURS, d TikTok, phased out, er the age of 21, pregnant or mursing, ducts, ES, GYCHEE F, warh, in 2024, |, PASSIONERUIT MANGO, .JUISE, WE FREE, N, 30, 2000 PUFFS!, XXL, 21., nors or persons, nder the age of 21., GUNNPOT, E-LIQUID, der the age of 21., 300 Pu, persons, US, COTTON CAO, EMAX FRIOBAR NANO DISPO, C TikTOK, immediate med, shipped in, KEFS, to, they just can't get new one, PINEAPPLE, 4500, 60, PUFFS!, REFILLABLE / RECHARGEAF, 6 s, under ti, they just can't get new o, from January 1st, 10 COLOURS, :, 2500 PUFFS!, CLOUD NURDZ 4500 PUF, SORT BY, Cl, GOKK"", of 21., C TikTok, SOLD OUT, E-LIQUIP, Australian vaping is changing, LI0, E-L, WUST, y, GI, $19.96 $24.95, GUNNPOD, 4.Smi, GO GUAVA, LUXURIOUS, 1st though, C TikTOk, G-SHOT, NICOTINE FREE, BERRIES, plenty of water., PASSIC, ILLABLE/ RECHARGEABLE, TKTo, TikTok, CE, Na fean, ge of 21., GOOBO, 4500 PUFFS!, 5500 PUFFS!, $21.56 $26.95, tsell the products, DO NOT use if, MAMA, 319.96 319):5, HZKO, B, INNPOD, FRIGBA, MARCH, UV, $19.96, 11 COLOURS, RICOTINE FREE, CHEE IO, $26.36 $32.95, 1500 PUFFS!, MLAX, 3500 PUFFS!, 6000 PUFFS!, E-LIOUIO, GUAVA RASPBERRY, SD, E-LI, FRU, is, VG, that means things like this, WARNING, stock, >a, they come with and bans on, 0%, Kecp away, @dailytelegraph, CTikTOK, LUURIOUS SHOSHA POOS, TUIST, SORT BY V, COTION CANDY, GUNNPOU, HdVA ENO, don't contain nicotine, )OUT, a, GUNNPOD 2000 PUFFS DISPO, -, Must be 18- years, .010, PACHA, RUIT MONSTER, 65% VG, Australian vaping, m, vegrtale, around who can sell vapes, IGET BAR D, your hands on one, foducts, what flavours and packaging, IPLAY MAX 2500 PUFFS DISPO, C &, UPT, BLUEBERF, PREMIUM, 65', .BERRY, HQD XXL DISPOSABLE VAPE, tor, FREEMAX FRIOBAR NANO DISPO, POMEGRANATE, HERRY, To, @dailyelegap, NICITINE, BLACKBERRY ICE, VAPE, $20.76 $25.95, te, BLACKBERRY, STRAWBE, For adults on, un, ins, 1800, ades, ., BL, IGET XXL DISPOSABLE, prescription, RASPBERRY MIN, G:, i, JID, C, SUSKPOO, ind, 4000 PUFFS!, For adults only., I, from that date, being banned even if they, SERRY, thi, P TO 1800 PUFFS, Fidd, or eyes flush with, J, $9.95, $34.95, RAWBERRY LUSH, little while longer though, 31 1234, shops can sell all, making and promoting them, PLAY, ml, u, CHE, SAVE 20%, to min, SMART, NEITH EPIC MOD 5500 PUFFS DISPOSABLE VAPE, sell the products, If exposed to skin, there's a ban on importing non, aI, ANT, GUNNP, Keep away from, children and pets., GOKK, so unless you have a, 17 COLOURS, COPES, CD, TWISCoo PLrS 6:3.5, No, ninors or persons, this product, S, 3500+, ainon, advice., BLUEBERRY, 1800 PUFFS!, CAD PNS, d, INGRECIENTS, Nurd, BRCTIC COL MIT, things get tighter from March, FRESH, therapeutic vapes, is changing, ON FRUIT, $15.96 $49.95, GUAVA RASPB, CLOUD NURDZ 4500 P, VaL XT, CHERI, 1, BLULBERRY, H2XO, 60 ml, IEE I, JERRY, @dailytelegrach, ONE VAPE, 6 COLOURS, CLASSIC TOBACCO, GIANT, childrea, .CHEI, 03901, al, E-LIOU, ice, Not, WARNING:, little guy will gradually be, If swallowed seek"

7328664307934317855,#fyp #reddit #redditstories #redditreadings #reddit_tiktok ," My dad neglected me for his narcissistic wife who wants to get rid of me. Now that they have a son they want me to move out. My dad and my mom separated a long time ago because my mom messed around a lot with substances. Her pregnancy was very high risk because she found it really hard to quit smoking and drinking. My dad made her quick cold turkey, but he would always find her with a drink in hand. I didn't suffer a lot for it, but it definitely messed me up. When my mom gave birth, my dad went through with a divorce and got full custody of me. Since it was just us for a long time, I got very used to his presence and being the only girl in his life. He was a very busy man, but he always made time to watch movies with me, take me on vacation out of state, we even went to Disney World once. It was amazing with it just being the two of us. But then Nina came into the picture. Nina was my dad's wife whom he married five years ago. I'll admit I didn't like her. She stole my dad away all the time. She would constantly want to go on dates with him so I had to stay with a babysitter or by myself when I got older. It got really lonely and I missed spending time with my dad. It seemed like Nina had it out for me and wanted him to start a new life with him and without me. She never even tried to bond with me. My dad would push for us to do girly things together, but Nina would always say she's too tired or say she already had plans. I got the hint and stopped involving myself with her. Because of this distance between us, my dad started to forget I existed. He would make dinner for the two of us and he got into the habit of only making portions for two. This meant that whenever he cooked, I would have to eat some leftovers or heat up some frozen food because Nina would always eat all of it. I've tried to talk to my dad about it, but he says I'm young and still trying to adjust to this life. I told him.",

Me getting pregnant at 14, my parents obviously didn't know I was having sex when I was 14. A lot of people lose their virginity as teenagers and their parents don't know because we don't really hide with my parents. And what does my boyfriend's actions have to do with my parents? And if you want to say they also feel me but I'm going to get pregnant again at 17 because people say that. Me and Jordan lived at our own apartment with our daughter so we didn't live with any of my parents. So what exactly are we supposed to do?

And what are you thinking? When do you cut off the curse? OK, so with, uh, with journey, I didn't really smoke like that at all. I just, I mean, I felt more sick. So so like once I found out, obviously, you know, when you find out you, you very early. So that, you know, that isn't really going to play. But I would never be big pregnant or even just journey. I was just so like, I mean, your second time, I talked about your first time, uh, which of on, I definitely was hidden, hidden, like, you know, a bong or hidden this, but I wasn't smoking back with I wasn't doing none of that. And then once I reached like five months, maybe six, I couldn't even, I was like, even being in the car was too much, but I was also 17 then.

You know, I'm saying, I'm smoking inside like the moment she found that she was pregnant. Yeah. No, I mean, yeah. And which I felt like it was over the top, but also like, okay, for sure. I mean, it depends on your body, depends on how you feel about it. For me, when I was trying to, with journey, more so I was smoking. If I hit something, it was more so like I was feeling sick or I was just not feeling good. But once you get that, once you get to a certain point, you're not supposed to smoke on God, you're not like, and you know that. It's common sense. You know, I'm not even a girl.

My basic advice matches @Dr. Peter Grinspoon: avoid using cannabis while pregnant unless necessary for your physical or mental health. Also, thanks to @Hank Green for his lovely razor.  #cannaeducation #pregnancy #prenatal #autism #adhd #apgar #birthdefects "," Are there harms the fetus if the mother smokes cannabis while pregnant? Yes, there are. And stoners, don't at me, bro, on this one. There are thousands of studies on this topic and hundreds of review papers. If you want to see my science archives on this DM me. But today we'll be covering birth effects, young life effects, adolescent effects, and birth defects. I'm Lex Pellger. I do Ken Education for CV Sciences, the makers of plus CBD on the cannabinoids. Ask me anything. Birth effects are where we have the clearest, most direct evidence. As you can see here, you have an increased risk for preterm birth, more admissions than neonatal intensive care unit, low birth weight, and small for gestational age infants. All of that makes complete sense because the endocannabinoid system is heavily involved in pregnancy. From the implantation all the way through the birth and delivery, as well as the formation of the placenta big time. And so it makes sense that screwing with your cannabinoid system is going to change these things. That being said, most of these aren't the end of the world. The largest estimate I've seen for a low birth weight is 200 grams. That's not a huge difference. You also see lower apgar scores for each children, which is measures of respiration and other things that they check out on an infant. And it makes sense that these would be lower because I've seen data in animals about how exposure to THG leads to not as good formation of the lungs and heart. This review also covers young life effects. So you see these children with disorders in their sleep cycle, memory problems, hyperactivity, as well as DNA methylation, which is attorney on and off of genes. We'll get to that in a second. Modifications in the brain, especially the mingdala. In addition, girls, and there's always gender differences with cannabis, girls had more aggressive behavior at the age of 18 months, shorter breastfeeding periods, and neodanodeth. Of course, we should always remember that Hank's razor could explain a lot of this, which is socioeconomic causes might always be the reason. Finally, the big question. Does prenatal cannabinoid exposure lead to autism or ADHD? And I would say probably, with the ability of the cannabinoids to turn on and off genes related to brain development that we have a lot of data on in animal models, as long as all this public health data put in this direction, it seems likely to answer to this is yes. That being said, I would say at least a third of the studies say no, this is not happening. But the other half to two third of the studies say it is. And when you have that kind of disagreement in the literature that usually means yes, there's a signal there, it's not just not a gigantic one. So is there a link? I do think so. But is it overwhelming? No. Finally, birth defects. These guys Reese and a wholesome out of Australia put out really excellent analysis of European public health data. And for serious congenital anomalies like missing limbs, cleft limb and palettes, serious malformations of the body, it's more likely to happen when you're using cannabis. Is a huge no out of 100,000 people, it might be a couple more cases, but still it's happening and we should be honest about it.","Book, Human face, Clothing, Man, Person , Albert Stuart Reece, on, heavily involved in pregnancy, A9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), developing central nervous system.
